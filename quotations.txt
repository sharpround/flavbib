In Jamaica, allspice is their pepper. It’s fruitier than black peppercorns. I think it’s especially nice with braised and roasted meats.
—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

Almonds are fairly versatile in that their flavor is not very specific. When they are manufactured, then they have a distinct flavor: think of Frangelico, almond oil, or marzipan in dessert. In these cases, the almond has a very distinct flavor.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

If you have some beautiful almonds, there are so many things you can do. You can grind them and make a frangipane and put it in puff pastry. You can put them into biscotti, a cake, or almond ice cream.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

No country in the world has anchovies like Spain. They are sophisticated, and the ones from the north of Spain are best because they are bigger. Spanish anchovies are not salty, either. Once you eat one, your life changes forever! I pay a lot for my anchovies—up to seventy-five cents per fillet—and will have to charge $9 for a plate. My customers will say that is too much to pay, and I agree—but if you don’t pay, you don’t taste. Lately, I have been combining anchovies with nectarines, which I love. I will make a vinaigrette with Pedro Ximénez [i.e., PX sherry], sherry vinegar, and olive oil and it is the perfect dressing—and unique.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

Angelica pairs well with fresh or candied ginger. And angelica with rhubarb really intensifies the flavor of the rhubarb.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

Anise seeds and fennel are used for braising our pork belly. Fennel and pork is a natural, just like in Italian sausage.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

As a kid, I hated black jelly beans. But I have grown to like all the various forms of anise, and star anise is one of my favorites. My favorite application is when it is infused with milk chocolate. It then has an almost malty-caramely quality to it. It adds that little something that people can’t quite identify. I also love pears with anise, which works well with roasted or poached pears.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I love using star anise in dishes from meats to desserts. I love how it can be kind of meaty in a stew, or kind of sweet, adding bright, warm notes to a pumpkin dessert.

The combination of apple and celery works. A tart green apple sorbet is not going to knock your socks off, because you are programmed to know it. When you add the flavor of celery, you get something new. I also love the flavors of apple and fennel together, especially in sorbet.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

For this dish you need a contrast for the sweetness, so the role of the lemon confit is to cleanse and refresh. If the confit was not there, you would have a bite of the sweet date and be done. The date and lemon is like a salad. The line drawing this together is the quince and dates that come from the Middle East and that was the line to ras el hanout.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

If you cook apples on top of the stove, some varieties will have a lot of juice while others will have none at all. Fuji, Gala, and Golden Delicious apples tend to be juicy, while Granny Smith apples are often drier. With different types of apples, you often don’t know exactly what they will do. So if I’m going to serve apples with gingerbread, I will sauté them in a little sugar and see what happens. If they are letting out a bunch of juice, I won’t add much sugar. If they are dry, I’ll add some apple juice or Calvados.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

When I make an apple pie, I won’t use any fewer than three different kinds of apples for their different textures and sweetnesses, which ensures that every single bite is interesting. I’ll use Galas or Golden Delicious apples for their sweetness in the middle of the pie, and soft Jonathans or McIntoshes on top for their ability to melt into the others, and Braeburns or Granny Smiths on the bottom for their ability to stay firm…. I can’t imagine an apple pie without cinnamon, a splash of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Apples and caramel are a wonderful combination and depending on what nut you add it will take the combination in very different directions. If you add pecans, it would make the combination a heavier winter dessert, versus adding almonds, which would keep it lighter. Both work; you just need to decide how heavy you want the dish.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Apple and shiso work well together. I especially like them together in a sorbet. I will use a Granny Smith apple that has a nice tartness combined with a little sugar, lemon, and then the shiso. The shiso has a cumin and cinnamon flavor that is a natural with apple.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

For our apple-eggplant dessert, we start with a choux dough piecrust. Then we layer an almond cream-like custard. Then we alternate apple and eggplant slices side by side. We use baby eggplant because it has a spongy texture and sucks up moisture from the cream that can otherwise make the crust soggy and absorb the juice and flavor from the apples that would normally just evaporate. So when you eat the eggplant and apples, the eggplant tastes like apples.
—DOMINIQUE AND CINDY DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)

In that spirit, we transformed this dessert. We transformed the wine by “espherication” so that it creates a bubble of liquid that explodes in your mouth. We cut apples with a melon baller, then vacuum-packed the apples with the wine but cooked it in such a way that the apples stayed hard and absorbed the wine flavor.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

We serve a dish of smoked oysters with apples. We smoke the oysters over applewood, and so it seemed logical to add apple to the dish. We serve it with a puree of apple with juniper that just plays beautifully off the oyster.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

Apricots are much better cooked than raw. It is rare that you find a fruit that reaches its full potential as cooked rather than raw, but an apricot is one. A so-so apricot poached will turn into heaven. They are great with either chamomile or lavender.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Apricot is a fruit you need to cook to help unleash its flavors. A bite of raw apricot is kind of bland and doesn’t excite very much. If you throw that same apricot into the oven and heat it up a bit, it turns into a whole different fruit. Apricot with vanilla is a match made in heaven.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

We believe as much as 90 percent of flavor is due to aroma as oppposed to taste.

Spring Artichoke Fritto with Yogurt, Mint, and Lemon Aioli
—Andrew Carmellini, A Voce (New York City)

My mom made artichokes that we dipped in mayonnaise, so I tweaked that idea for the stuffed artichoke we serve here. Panko bread crumbs are mixed with chopped mint, salted, and stuffed into the artichoke cavity. The homemade mayonnaise I serve is made with eggs and just a little olive oil but mostly melted butter, which makes it richer and more flavorful—which is based on how it is made for the Chinese dish of shrimp and walnuts. The mayonnaise is then seasoned with anchovies, red pepper flakes, and onion confit.

—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

In the fall, I’ll make more cakes. Fall also turns into caramel season, and fall fruits work so well with caramel. I keep a lighter hand with caramel in the fall because it is being combined with fruit versus chocolate.

Avocados are so rich that we always season them with a lot of fleur de sel and lemon juice, and toss them with frisée and endive. Avocados need something bitter for balance.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Bacon can be salt, fat, and/or smoke, depending on the bacon you choose. You can also play with its texture, depending on whether you are using pork belly or crispy bacon. It is wonderful with vegetables. The fat is delicious, so if you are braising onions in bacon fat, reduce that down, and add a little onion jus and vinegar, you have a great sauce. Bacon just brings another layer of flavor to the vegetables. My dish of Berkshire pork chop with scarlet turnips, roasted rhubarb, and smoked bacon with cherry-almond salsa seca represents the relationship between fat, salt, sugar, and acid; they are all there. The bacon brings complexity to the pork; the cherry brings acid balance; and the almond brings a different kind of fat with crunch. The almonds in the dish are marcona, and every tenth one is extremely bitter, which adds another layer of complexity.

A banana in a dessert is an instant sell. Everyone loves caramelized bananas!
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

I hate overripe bananas. We’ll actually freeze whole, unpeeled bananas, which will continue to ripen in the freezer and turn black. When we want bananas to use as a puree, we’ll pull them out and let them thaw before pureeing, and then add them to a cake or mousse. The flavor is much better this way.
—DOMINIQUE DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)

I serve a banana crème brûlée that is not made in ramekins (the usual individual serving cups) but cut out of a sheet pan and caramelized. I serve this set up in a grid with two squares of crème brûlée, one topped with a little citrus, the other with caramelized bananas—alternated with citrus biscuit, one topped with a brown butter ice cream, and the other with caramelized banana. So I have these three flavors—banana, citrus, and brown butter—tied together with a salted peanut–caramel sauce.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

A banana’s ripeness will determine what you do with it. I like my bananas yellow and firm. If you are going to make a bananas Foster and your bananas are very yellow, you can cook them longer and they won’t fall apart or turn to mush. If you start with a banana that is pretty brown, the second you add heat, it falls apart. A brown banana gives me shivers!
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

In Thai cooking, you will find coconut milk–based curry that will have whole leaves of basil in it. Basil becomes something of a vegetable served this way.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

I love basil in syrups. It works with strawberries and any citrus fruit. The trio I use the most for summer fruits like berries is basil, lemon, and vanilla. I have even macerated cherry tomatoes in this combination and made them into a fruit crisp.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I love basil. It is more familiar than cilantro, and more people like it. I use it in ceviche instead of cilantro because it is not as pungent. I combine hamachi tuna with tomato, watermelon, yuzu, and sesame seeds with fresh basil and basil oil.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

I use this in lots of vegetarian dishes because it gives them some oomph. It also works well with meat dishes, from beef to carpaccio to venison. I make a Thai basil pesto but make a few adjustments to the recipe or else it can look bruised and take on a funky color. We will add a little pumpkin seed oil to keep it a deep, rich green.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Black bass is a fish that can go with the most exotic flavors. We serve black bass with Peking duck, green papaya salad, and a very light, thin chutney sauce. I love Peking duck and find the flavor very soft and not “duck-y” or aggressive.

In my black sea bass in a tamarind-ginger sauce with minted baby onions dish, the tamarind is acidic, and ginger is a nice flavor bridge. I put mint in the onions to cut their sweetness.

I am a little too fond of bay leaf. I use it a lot. I probably have a fondness for it because I associate it with so many childhood flavors, like pot roast. It has a hearty quality to it and I associate it with stocks and big flavors. I will use fresh or dried bay leaf. Fresh bay leaf has fresher flavor and is surprisingly more intense than dried bay leaf, but it’s still not as dramatic a difference as you can find with other herbs when it comes to fresh versus dried.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

Inexperienced cooks will throw a handful of bay leaves into 40 gallons of veal stock. What happens next is they go to make a sauce and can’t figure out what to do about the medicinal taste. It’s the bay leaf! I’ll explain they only need two or three at the most.

Fava beans have a great flavor. Cooks in the past would blanch them, and the flavor would be left in the water. Today, what I like to do with favas and other vegetables is to put them in a pan with a little water, olive oil, or butter, and to cover them while they cook. That way, all the flavor stays in the vegetables. If I could cook for my customers the way I like to cook and eat at home, I would sweat some spring onions in a pan with butter or oil, covered, to keep in the flavor. Then I’d add the shucked fava beans and let them cook with a little water. At the last second, I’d toss in some chopped parsley or basil, and there’s your sauce. This would be great under some fish. If you added some thyme and maybe a little lamb jus, it would also work with lamb.
—TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIÈRE (SAN FRANCISCO)

Fava beans have a very delicate flavor, I like them raw and tender by themselves—or combined with sheep’s milk cheese and olive oil. However, I wouldn’t use an olive oil that’s too peppery or spicy, because it would overwhelm them.

I love blue cheese with beef. We make a dish with blue cheese sauce that has chicken stock, Dijon mustard, truffle juice, and fresh truffle. This is a sauce that has many layers of flavor. The mustard is barely there but adds much more flavor to the sauce than vinegar or lemon would. The sauce is served on a [beef] filet that has been poached in spiced red wine. The poaching liquid is made with Cabernet Sauvignon that has been reduced for 25 minutes to concentrate its flavor, juniper berries, pepper, star anise, fennel seeds, and cloves. The cooked tannin in the wine really brings up the meaty flavor of the beef.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

All cuts of beef have a different flavor profile: There is the big beefy flavor of the strip steak, the luxurious tenderness of filet mignon, and the juicy, fatty mouthfeel of a great rib eye. Skirt steak is a juicy cut that is great served as an open-faced sandwich. Hanger steak has an offal quality to it and is different from all the others. Braised short ribs pick up all of the flavors of what they are cooked with, developing layers of deep, dark beef flavor after being cooked on the bone for hours.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

We make a wood-grilled 18-ounce “prime” rib eye of beef with a gratin of macaroni and goat cheese, glazed shallots, oxtail red wine sauce, and fleur de sel. This dish is meat on meat on meat! We have the steak, oxtail sauce, and shallots braised in veal stock. This dish has so much flavor. You have the richness and fattiness of the rib eye, and we grill it over a wood fire that takes it to a whole other place. Top it with a drizzle of olive oil, the fleur de sel, cracked pepper, and then add rich oxtail sauce to it. People go crazy for it.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

You can braise brisket for hours, and it still tastes like brisket, making it ideal to prepare for large parties. Nothing is better than what the Texans do with brisket, and that is barbecue. I also noticed that Texans get the fattiest brisket I have ever seen, so the fat just melts away and the meat is self-basting. My favorite barbecued brisket is from Mueller’s outside of Austin. He cooks it about twenty hours and then wraps it in brown butcher paper to let it rest—which I think is the key to his barbecue.

This is the T-bone steak. When it is cut double cut [that is, twice as thick], that is when it is a porterhouse. The story goes that it was first served in Lower Manhattan in 1815 at a porter house. The owner ran out of his usual cut of meat, and when a customer asked for something to go with his porter [beer], the owner cut him this huge piece of meat. It became known as a “porterhouse” steak. The porterhouse steak is part filet mignon and part strip steak. It is the perfect grilling steak. You get the tenderness of the filet, and the big beefy chewiness of the strip steak.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

For braising, I prefer to use cinnamon bark. Cinnamon stick is pretty, but it is steamed and rolled and a little too manipulated. In this dish, cinnamon bark is big and intense and not needed for presentation. At the end of the braise, you pull it out and throw it away. This dish is cooked for four hours and the cinnamon flavor does not cook out. In the end, the cinnamon imparts a delicate, sweet, aromatic flavor. It adds contrast to the chile flavor from the curry. If this dish ever has too much cinnamon flavor, you can counterbalance it with rice or yogurt that has a little salt and pepper in it.

Short ribs are a luxurious cut of meat, because they are braised for three to three and a half hours. We don’t braise our ribs in red wine, but in Yuengling Porter, which has ethereal chocolate notes in the aroma. In the sauce with the beer is mirepoix, a sachet of herbs, lots of peppercorns, and chiles. I went to a charity event where they served short ribs for six hundred guests, and one reason it worked is because it is a cut that allows for a great margin of error. You cook it until it is well done and falling-off-the-bone tender. Falling-offthe-bone tender is one of the appeals of a braised dish. It is sensual. Get yourself a glass of good spicy Syrah with that short rib dish and think great thoughts!
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

I like to keep it simple and serve steak au poivre with a peppercorn crust and deglazed with bourbon or even good ole American rye, which has more flavor. I also like steak with a margarita sauce, which is a good, zingy sauce made with tequila, orange, and lemon zest, and finished with roasted chile peppers.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

This cut is really beefy, flavorful, and fatty, but tough. Chuck steak can be grilled, but it also works well for braising. A chuck also makes a good cut for stew because it has nice fat. When I was growing up, a “steak Episole” was chuck steak that had good fat, was seared well, and then cooked slowly with tomatoes, onions, and fresh oregano. You may not see chuck steak a lot on menus, but you see it a lot in burgers. In fact, this is my favorite meat for a burger. I like my mix to be 75 to 80 percent lean and 20 to 25 percent fat.

—Allen Susser, Chef Allen’s (Aventura, Florida)

Filet mignon gets no respect from many chefs because it doesn’t have much beef flavor, but it is still the most popular cut in restaurants. I like to sear it and pan roast it with a little olive oil or an olive oil and butter combination. It is not a well-used muscle on the inside of the short loin, so filet is always tender. On the other side of the bone from the more worked side of the strip steak is the tail end of the filet. Béarnaise sauce [i.e., vinegar, shallots, egg yolks, butter, etc.] is a classic accompaniment to filet mignon.

Hanger Steak Pizzaiola with Local Peppers, Salsa Verde, Natural Juices
—Andrew Carmellini, A Voce (New York City)

We make tartare from filet mignon and hand-chop it to order, which I like so that I don’t feel like I’m just eating ground beef. I season our tartare with mustard, capers, and anchovies, which I am not shy about. You want the texture of the beef to be a counterpoint.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

Skirt steak comes in a long strip and looks like a belt—it’s about two feet long and a couple of inches wide. This is an incredibly flavorful cut and delicious. It is very reasonably priced as well. It is very popular in the Latin community, especially with Argentinians. You often see it flattened with a mallet to tenderize it [by breaking the meat fibers] and used in fajitas. This, along with the hanger steak, is the beefiest flavored cut of beef. We serve it in a chimichurri sauce, which is a classic Argentinian sauce made of chopped garlic, onion, and parsley, plus white [we use champagne] vinegar, red pepper flakes, and a little olive oil. It grills really well.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

Hanger steak is known as an onglet in French and is found on bistro menus. It is also a great value, which is why you see it on menus in smaller restaurants. A hanger steak is incredibly flavorful. There is only one per carcass, and it comes from the area close to the kidneys, so it has almost an offal flavor to the beef. It has become popular because it is different and not a typical-tasting steak. I like a hanger steak grilled and served rare to medium rare. Slicing is also important, because you have to cut it on the bias so that it is tender. I like a hanger steak served with a traditional sauce, such as a caramelized shallot and red wine sauce or a bourbon peppercorn sauce. It is important to caramelize the shallots so they get sweet and offset the gaminess of the steak. I use bourbon instead of cognac because it has more punch to it, and I’ll use four different peppercorns—white, black, pink, and green—with the last two modulating the flavor. Green peppercorns have the sharpness to cut through the richness.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

Rib steak is the most popular cut next to filet mignon. The cut comes from the rib roast, where one end meets the chuck at the fattier end and the other meets the short loin at the leaner end. The rib steak that meets the chuck end is the most popular and can even have a big knot of fat in it. This is one of my favorite steaks. A big, fatty, juicy rib steak can’t be beat on the grill. I cook these bone-on because it gives more beef flavor. We do a Brandt Ranch cut that comes from California just north of Mexico. That area has lots of flavor influences, so I choose to do a chili rub on the steak. The cut is Holstein, which has a sweeter edge to its meat. We grill it so that fat melts away and bastes it as it cooks. At the end, we brush it with a blend of ancho chili, light brown sugar, toasted ground cumin seeds, chipotle chile, and a pinch of cayenne. Then we char it one more time, so that is like reseasoning the meat.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

The sirloin is a good, beefy-flavored high-quality cut. It is a cut toward the back of the animal that gets more work, so it is a little chewy, but it is a good-quality steak for barbecuing. If this cut is quickly cooked over high heat on a grill, not overcooked, and sliced correctly on the bias, you are going to get the most out of it.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

When you see rare roast beef, it is top round. It is a little tough, and that is why you see roast beef always sliced so thin. Nothing beats top round for a good old-fashioned roast beef sandwich because it doesn’t have any gristle or fat—just good, beefy flavor.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

When I was in Ireland, I swilled Guinness [stout] and ate bangers and mash, which was essentially sausage with caramelized onions on top. It was so good that when I came back to the U.S., I started experimenting with Guinness. That’s how I came up with a dish of braised short ribs that had been marinated in Guinness. The problem you often have cooking with beer is that sometimes the dish gets bitter. So, to counteract that naturally without using sugar, I choose to use onions. I marinate the ribs in the beer, then braise them, and finish the dish with a puree of roasted onions for balance.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Beets are especially delicious when accented by a salty cheese, whether queso fresco or ricotta salata.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

People love fresh beets. Now I won’t lay claim to inventing beet salad with Gorgonzola and hazelnuts, but how our version is different from many others is that we marinate the beets. Overnight, we’ll marinate peeled beets in Barolo vinegar, shallots, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Using Russian and Polish cooking principles, marinating the beets ensures that the vinegar is able to penetrate them so that they are sure to be tangy.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

I wanted to take beets that are associated with winter and make them into something summery, so I used them for a ceviche. We roasted and pureed them with lime and froze them into a sorbet. We served the beet sorbet flat in a bowl so it looked like soup. From there, we layered thinly sliced raw bay scallops with segments of lime, cilantro, and red onion oil. The dish is very fresh tasting. The other key to this dish was that we had all the flavors of ceviche but did not marinate the scallops in the acid, which makes them rubbery. The scallops treated this way are more delicate, like sushi.

—Thierry Rautureau, Rover’s (Seattle)

We serve a salad that showcases the classic combination of beets, walnuts, and orange. We boil our beets, then slice them thinly on the plate. We add frisée to the salad and, since it is bitter, we mix in Cambozola cheese and candied walnuts. We dress the salad with a sherry-walnut-tarragon vinaigrette, and a mandarin orange sauce. People are surprised when they eat the dish—first, because they find out they like beets, and second, because the frisée is not bitter after being softened by the sweet touches.
—MONICA POPE, T’AFIA (HOUSTON)

I like to intensify the flavor of beets by serving them prepared in different ways on the same dish, such as accenting roasted beets with crunchy beet chips and a spiced beet coulis. And I love anything aniseflavored with beets, whether fennel or anise itself.

The sweetness of red bell peppers and the acidity of sherry vinegar make for a perfect combination.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

A lot of people find the skin a turnoff on green bell peppers, so I’ll peel them and cook them, which releases their juice. They’re great cooked down with chorizo, garlic, and onions, which you can serve with shrimp over rice.

a little of this and it will fix it! It is superb. I add it to all sorts of things—even pasta.

So many Western cultures don’t incorporate bitterness into their food. In India and Asia, it is a component of a balanced dish. If you give most of America rice with lime pickle, they will not be thrilled. It will be too sour, bitter, and spicy. To introduce the bitter flavor of lime pickle, we will puree it with yogurt and use it for a marinade for whole prawns. That way, it isn’t overwhelming.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I used to love dishes that were rich on rich—but the older I get, the more I look forward to that bitterness, the cleansing bite that makes you want to go back for your next forkful of a dish. Almost every dish in our kitchen is finished with some kind of bitter leaf to serve as a balancing component. That’s why I serve cress or watercress with a steak and potato dish, and arugula with our seared bluefin tuna on braised veal cheeks, and a bed of bitter greens like watercress, frisée, arugula, and shaved endive as the base for our foie gras dish—to cut the richness.

I don’t brine automatically. If I have a chicken that I know will cook up on the dry side, then I will brine it first. If it is a great chicken that will cook up naturally juicy and doesn’t need help, then I won’t. You can make a pretty strong brine for squab or even chicken—for instance, with thyme or even chile pepper—and the meat will pick up some flavors, but it’s still very subtle.

Butterscotch-Praline Ice Cream Parfait
—Rebecca Charles, Pearl Oyster Bar (New York City)

One of my favorite flavors in the world is brown butter. A financier cake made with brown butter is one of the best things ever. I have been making a brown butter vinaigrette for a jillion years! It is a super-easy pan sauce that I love as a warm sauce: I just brown my butter in a pan until it gets the noisette [brown] color, then add some balsamic vinegar. It doesn’t even need to be expensive balsamic. You make an emulsification in the pan, and add a little salt and pepper and it’s done. The flavor of brown butter, salt, and acid is one of my favorites. It works well on different fish like scallops or halibut or soft-shell crabs.
—TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIÈRE (SAN FRANCISCO)

Butter tastes great on its own, and in making brown butter you are not adding anything to it—just transforming it, so that it becomes more. The process is simple but a little tricky, as it keeps cooking even after it is off the stove. Something you can do to improve it is—halfway through the cooking process—start whisking the butter, because it intensifies the flavor if you keep the particles suspended.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Cabbage often has the connotation of being heavy, but in the fall, we’ll make a fine chiffonade of cabbage that’s very light. I like to cut cabbage thin and roast it in a pan so that the edges just get brown because that tastes really good. We figured that out by mistake by putting cabbage into too hot a pan. After the chef raised his voice about how that is the wrong way to cook cabbage, we tasted it, and it was good! We now serve a green cabbage dish cooked this way with caraway seeds and walnuts, then deglazed with Calvados. We also add a little cider vinegar and olive oil to finish. It is a nice, easy marriage. It is not an unpredictable marriage; these things just all work together. We pair this with braised pork belly, but it would also work with a roasted breast of squab with its leg done in a confit.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Thumbelina carrots are something I missed when I moved from working in the country [i.e., Pocantico Hills, New York, where Blue Hill at Stone Barns is located] into Manhattan. Luckily, I recently found these short, fat carrots at the green market. We sauté these carrots over an open fire so that they get a little smoky. When they are cooked, they become soft and creamy. Once cooked, we turn them into a puree with a shot of carrot juice at the last second. We pair this with farro that has been cooked like risotto, then add some pine nuts and more Thumbelina carrots that have been quartered. I don’t know what is more seductive: the smooth carrot farro with its light carrot flavor or the carrots themselves that are totally creamy. The dish has no butter or cream but that is not because we are trying to be healthy. The dish just doesn’t need it.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Juices are a great way to freshen up a dish. If you cook a carrot, you lose the “carrotiness” of it. If you make a carrot soup with cooked carrots, it doesn’t become bright. So now we do a carrot base with cooked organic carrots with tops, onions, garlic, and maybe some ginger and lemongrass. With that base we make a really thick soup and then add carrot juice to it. In the end you have fresh and cooked carrots for a better flavor profile.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

I had a salad at a restaurant with grated carrots and tarragon leaves with pistachios—and I knew the minute I tasted it that I could adapt this salad to be my own. Instead of grating the carrots, I cut them on the bias and roasted them with a little ginger and juca [an African mix made of almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts, and spices]. To finish the salad, I added the whole tarragon leaves, great pistachio oil, and a raita of yogurt and golden raisins. The dish has wonderful colors and texture and those beautiful whole leaves of tarragon which I had never thought to do myself.
—MONICA POPE, T’AFIA (HOUSTON)

Carrots—which pair well with allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin—are one of the few vegetables that shine in desserts. When I first came to the U.S. I discovered carrot cake and that you could use carrots for dessert. I have since made carrot ice cream, cookies, and fruit paste. The problem is that most people trust carrot cake but little else. When I am using carrots for dessert, I like to cook them with orange.

The first time I had the combination of cauliflower and curry was when I worked with Daniel Boulud, and he used them together in a soup. I didn’t grow up liking cauliflower, but I do now when it’s well roasted or pureed. It has good water content, which makes for a very smooth puree, and it has a subtle yet distinct flavor. Apple combines well with both, as it adds acidity and crunch while cutting the stronger flavors.
—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

Our dish of spicy roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and lime is cauliflower with lime supremes [skinless lime sections]. I love lime because it has more character than lemon.

There is an obvious reason why you could argue that white chocolate and caviar go together and that is because of the fact that you are pairing fat and salt. The combination, however, runs a lot deeper than that. The amine [organic chemical compounds] levels in caviar and white chocolate are such that the two ingredients almost “melt” together.

Using a pinch of cayenne is like having a turbo versus a regular engine in your car. The cayenne goes into you so fast it is like creating an engine for your flavors. It will create a certain heat and speedy access to your flavors. I use cayenne in everything. However, it has to be done carefully. It has to be just a pinch at the last minute. If you are using basil, it will make the flavor even stronger.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Of all vegetables, celery has one of the strongest flavors. To me, it is almost like a truffle. In a mirepoix, you need all the vegetables—but if I could have only one, it would be celery. I love its earthy flavor. Celery and black truffles are my favorite combination. They work in part because they come out of the ground at the same time of year. Any root vegetable also works with celery. I enjoy celery root and celery separately as well as together.

Which cheeses? My faves with my espresso to which I add a little unfiltered raw honey would be the pressed sheep milk cheeses: Ossau Iraty, Roncal, Zamorano, Berkswell, Spenwood, Trade Lake Cedar, Vermont Shepherd, manchego, or Pecorino Foglie Noce. But I’m happy with whatever is looking good, and preferably the harder aged cheeses: sheep, goat, or cow.
—MAX McCALMAN, ARTISANAL CHEESE CENTER (NEW YORK CITY)

With aged or strong cheese, you need something fruity or sweet to contrast with the strong flavor. Pecorino is very strong, so you need something sweet with it. With an aged or hard cheese, I like to serve some chestnut honey, a fruit jam, or watermelon confiture. If I have some aged goat cheese, I like a mostarda [Italian mustard fruit]. With sharper cheese, I also like a nice sweet wine, especially an Italian Passito. With fresh young cheese, I simply like some good bread. Chestnut honey, while good with aged cheese, does not work with a young cheese.
—ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)

Honey, jam, and mostarda go great with cheese. Most honey works best with younger cheeses and soft-ripened cheeses, especially if they have a chalky quality to them. I love mountain Gorgonzola with chestnut honey; it is crazy! In Italy, we call jam a confitura or marmalata. I like it with saltier cheeses like Parmesan, or with more assertive cheeses. Mostarda is made of fruits cooked in a white wine mustard syrup until they are candied. So, you have a sweet candy effect with the spicy mustard. It goes with any savory firm cheese, and particularly well with pecorino and Taleggio.

—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

If you are going to make a dessert with cheese, you want it to be a softer cheese. I make a goat cheese cake with berries and for that I use a milder goat cheese. Goat cheese and lemon work really well together, because the acidity of the lemon juice cuts the fat of the goat cheese.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I like strawberries with my Loire Valley chèvres.
—MAX McCALMAN, ARTISANAL CHEESE CENTER (NEW YORK CITY)

Some enjoy the combination of chocolate and cheese. If the idea intrigues you, I recommend trying a good dark chocolate with an aged Alpine cheese [a style native to the French and Swiss Alps, of which Gruyère is one of the most famous], such as Hoch Ybrig, Appenzeller, or Prattigauer.
—MAX McCALMAN, ARTISANAL CHEESE CENTER (NEW YORK CITY)

Swiss mountain cheeses [e.g., Appenzeller, Comté, Gruyère] are a cheese snob’s Holy Grail of cheeses. Their “cooked milk” character makes them great with dark, cooked fruit preserves such as fig preserves. They also go well with oloroso sherry, which has its own dark, cooked fruit flavors.

Cherries can stand up to a lot of flavors. They have more juice to them as well as complexity. Almonds go with cherries. Dark chocolate actually goes better with cherries than it does raspberries, and white chocolate works with cherries as well.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

If you have perfect ingredients in the summertime, you don’t have to do much to them. With our perfect cherries [Michigan, while at Tribute restaurant], we halved them, sprinkled them with sugar, and heated them with a blowtorch so that they were just warmed through. The slightly caramelized sugar made a huge difference in the flavor. I used a goat cream cheese worked to a texture similar to mascarpone cheese, which I shaped into quenelles. Served alongside were some ice wine vinegar caramel sauce and a crispy crepe. Before serving, I added individual thyme leaves and a crack of black pepper. These are all really classic flavors, especially the cheese with black pepper and cherries.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I was reading an old Fannie Farmer cookbook from the late 1800s about making cherry jam. In the recipe, they would take the cherry pits and crush them. I thought it was crazy but tried it. When you take cherry pits and crush them, it gives you an almond flavor. I made some pickled sour cherries with the crushed pits in cheesecloth with the pickling liquid and I got this great almondy flavor that went deep inside the cherries.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

I like to let them shine on their own. But I do really like cherries and grappa. Mario [Batali] has a home in Michigan and he brought me back a case of cherries. They were so perfect I just macerated them in grappa and torn mint leaves. I served them in a bowl with a dollop of mascarpone. Cherries also work well with mint.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

I loved cherries so much growing up that I would climb up our cherry tree and eat as many as I could. Then I would realize I didn’t know how to get back down and would cry until the neighbors would get me down. I still love cherries and especially in cherry pie or a clafoutis. Cherries work well with vanilla or poached in red wine, but I like to keep them as simple as possible.

One thing chervil has going for it is its looks. Chervil is so cute, it is adorable! You can very carefully make little tiny brushes of them and put them around the plate. Not only does it taste good, but it says to the people eating the dish that you are taking care of them.

Chestnut Sugar Tart, Crème Fraîche
—Johnny Iuzzini, pastry chef, Jean Georges (New York City)

I like to take one ingredient and see how much I can do with it. I made a frozen chestnut semifreddo with bits of candied chestnuts. This was then set on an orange-soaked chestnut sponge cake, next to a chestnut wafer and chestnut paste. I needed a complementary flavor, and I have always liked the combination of pear and chestnut. They both have a richness but depending on how the pear is handled, it can add freshness and acidity. I roasted the pear in sugar, butter, and ice wine vinegar and finished it in the oven until soft. The pear was then diced tartare-like and had orange confit added. The juices from the pear were the only sauce.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Chestnuts have a bursty flavor and they work with chocolate and pears. You have to combine them with earthy flavors. If you paired chestnuts with berries, they would just get lost.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Red beans and rice with andouille sausage is my favorite! When we opened up after the hurricane [Katrina] and were serving on paper plates, I made a roasted Tabasco chicken served with dirty rice, with the sausage stuffed in a bell pepper alongside red bean puree. For another dish, I was inspired by a diner down the street from us that had chicken and waffles on the menu, which is an old Southern dish. My take is to make a savory waffle and to add Boursin cheese with lots of herbs. Then I pair it with chicken thighs braised in a coq au vin blanc and serve it with spinach. The dish is simple, but I just love the flavors.

I have made a red-hot apple gelée that was a garnish to a panna cotta, taking apple cider and infusing it with cinnamon and jalapeño chile—which ended up tasting like red-hot candy. I like using fresh jalapeños in an infusion, or an espelette as a finishing note. I also love the idea of chipotle chile paired with chocolate ice cream.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

In Chinese cooking they have a technique called “red cooking” that is a dish braised or steamed with star anise, dark soy sauce, cinnamon, and rock sugar. I cook the oxtail for my timbale of oxtail and foie gras that way, and then clarify the broth and turn it into the aspic that holds the dish together. The foie gras is cooked separately and made into a terrine. The dish is then served with gingery pickled vegetables. It is not a Chinese dish in that it is not a dish that you would find in a Chinese restaurant, but it has Chinese influences. The idea of clarifying the broth is typically French. The use of foie gras is not very Chinese. The pickled vegetables are like something you might find in Chinese cooking, but they are done in perfect dice and served as a relish.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

You can’t cook without onions, and chives are a delicate way to get that flavor into a dish. They are good in a soup or a sauce. A chive oil is great drizzled around a plate for flavor as well as appearance.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE

My chocolate-corn dessert [of soft chocolate ganache and sweet corn in three textures: crunchy corn and hazelnut corn sorbet, and corn tuile] was inspired by freeze-dried corn. [The kernels] are whole with a vibrant sweetness. Corn dates back to the Aztecs, who also loved chocolate, so it’s funny when people ask, “Where’d you get the inspiration?” This starts with a layer of milk chocolate hazelnut praline paste, then the corn, and then crushed wafers that give it that Kit Kat candy bar texture; on top of that is some chocolate ganache, then a layer of chocolate. To play off those flavors I serve some espelette [pepper] to give a little heat and some smoked salt from Wales. This dish is about the interplay of the chocolate and the corn. The espelette gives a heat that reminds me of roasted corn salsa. This is an ode to the origin of the inspiration.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

It is hard to think of a fruit or nut that is not improved by combining it with chocolate.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

I love chocolate with fruit or nuts or both. My favorite candy bar in the world is a Cadbury Fruit and Nut bar. On my menu I have a chocolate, hazelnut, and orange dessert, which is essentially a Cadbury!
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

If you want to dip fruit into chocolate, dried fruits such as figs, pear, and pineapple all work really well. People always ask what they can serve to impress their sweetheart on Valentine’s Day, and fresh strawberries are really nice in February. Just make a warm ganache, grab the strawberries, and start dipping. Fresh grapes are fantastic with chocolate. Dip them into the melted chocolate, pop them in the freezer, and when they are frozen, put them into a two-quart container. That way, you will always have a little treat in the freezer. Be careful though—they are not M&Ms, so they will melt in your hands!
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Everybody is on the chocolate bandwagon now, and we are not far away from the proverbial “man on the street” knowing the difference between a 72 percent and a 66 percent chocolate. The boutique chocolate makers are now coming up with estate and varietal and vintage chocolates. I love that, but honestly, once you add enough sugar and cream to chocolate, those nuances are all gone.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I’m not a fan of herbs with dessert, with the possible exception of chocolate. I love the combination of chocolate with mint.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I don’t have a big sweet tooth but I do like all kinds of chocolate, from dark to white. Each one is completely different. I like the bitterness and clean flavor of dark chocolate. I like milk chocolate with a piece of bread like when I was a kid. You have to select your white chocolate carefully because not all of it is good. White chocolate works well in a mousse; it has a more neutral flavor and does not dictate. Dark chocolate is all about being the star, versus white, that is better to play with.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Dark chocolate goes really well with coffee or caramel, but if I could only pick one it would be the caramel! Caramel and chocolate play so well together despite both being strong flavors.

Dark Chocolate–Jalapeño Ice Cream Sundae
—Janos Wilder, Janos (Tucson)

I make a cake with dark cocoa, which makes for a bitter chocolate flavor, and then in the middle a milk chocolate cream. Many people don’t realize how great the chocolate flavor of cocoa is. It adds bitterness and intensity without adding richness. That is invaluable because so many chocolate desserts are so rich. Often when I make a chocolate ice cream, I will combine melted chocolate and cocoa.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Starting with chocolate, caramel was the logical next step. At the time, I played with fleur de sel, red salt from Hawaii, and others, before ending up with the Maldon. I like the concept of using sugar as a seasoning, beyond its natural necessity in dessert. I also like natural sweetness from things and maple sugar brings a lot of flavor beyond sweetness. Once I hit upon this combination, I have never changed it.

Creamy White Chocolate and Cranberry Risotto with Roasted Apricots

White Chocolate and Rice Milk Flan with Pistachio Emulsion
—Dominique and Cindy Duby, Wild Sweets (Vancouver)

Valrhona and El Rey are both good. When you are looking for a white chocolate, you want one that has some smoothness to it. It is not going to have the acidity that dark chocolate has. When you are making a dessert with white chocolate, it is going to be a softer, smoother dessert. I don’t like dark chocolate and raspberries together, but I believe I am one of the few chefs who feel this way. What I don’t like is that when you take a bite of the chocolate with the berry, the acidity of the two don’t blend. The acids are too similar, so it doesn’t feel like a single dessert in your mouth. Instead, it is a clash with both of them bouncing into each other in your mouth. They don’t bridge, and even whipped cream doesn’t bring them together. But if you use white chocolate, its softness works much better with berries. The white chocolate complements the berries and brings out their flavors. Citrus, especially anything in the orange family, also works well with white chocolate. Nuts, such as almonds, work well with white chocolate. Spices also work well with white chocolate.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

After a visit to Spain, I created a chorizo broth to go with monkfish. I love chorizo, with its paprika flavors and the fattiness of the pork. So I had to figure out how to make a sauce out of a dried piece of sausage. We melted the chorizo in a pan for a long time, and ended up with a flavorful grease that was not that appealing. However, we emulsified it in an herb-infused clam broth, and it became velvety. It wasn’t greasy, and gave the sauce a little kick. I chose this sauce to go with monkfish because it is a meaty fish and can stand up to spice and to strong flavors really well. Chorizo would not destroy the soul of the fish.

I like the anise-seed quality to cilantro, which is really good with figs.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I really like using cilantro for its lemony and floral qualities, even though it’s very non-European. I’ll put cilantro stems [not the leaves] in the cavity when I’m roasting a chicken, and I find it lifts the flavor. Cilantro stems are also wonderful in Spanish-themed stews when there’s a lot of depth of flavor from ingredients like chorizo, chickpeas, oxtails, or tripe, and it needs a high note.
—TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)

Love it or hate it, cilantro is in a lot of my dishes! I love its citrus flavor. Cilantro has long legs; we use it to make cilantro oil as well as purees. It lends itself well to white meats but I have even put it on hanger steak and wild boar. I also like it with coconut milk.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I use Saigon cinnamon that is the most amazing cinnamon you will ever try. It comes in a chip [as opposed to a stick] and is like the cinnamon used to make red-hots [candy]. I use it in a ganache.

—MEERA DHALWALA, VIJ’S (VANCOUVER)

Crab is something that you typically see steamed and served with butter. King crab is intensely flavorful, meaty, and salty. When it is caught at sea, it is cooked on the boat with heavily salted water. The first thing I did was soak the crab multiple times in ice water to draw out all the salt. I saw and created a vision of this red crabmeat within a barigoule with perfectly cut vegetables, artichokes, French green beans, Valencia oranges, sweet garlic, and finished with olive oil.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

When you eat a piece of pumpkin pie, the whipped cream is the first thing you go for! You can take this for granted in desserts, or you can dig deeper: You can think of cream as its own flavor. When I was in Japan, the cream was miles better than here in the U.S. You also need to think about your dairy choice in relation to the country. In India, everything is centered around reduced milk. The counterpart would be dolce de leche in Latin cuisine. I love yogurt because it is simple and complex; it can be in the forefront or in the background.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Your choice of sugar suggests a country of origin. For example, Cuban cuisine relies on white sugar, while Mexican cuisine relies on brown sugar.
—MARICEL PRESILLA, ZAFRA (HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY)

With lighter dishes like rice pilaf or lentils, I use cumin seeds for their gentler flavor. With heavier dishes like chickpeas, kidney beans, or red meat, I’ll use the stronger-flavored cumin powder.
—MEERU DHALWALA, VIJ’S (VANCOUVER)

Torrijas, which means “soaked,” are a [custardy] dessert in the Basque country that are like French toast or pain perdu. We soak the bread until it is saturated in milk, then let it sit [in the refrigerator] overnight. The next morning before serving, we coat it in egg and then fry it. We serve our version of torrijas with poached apples and instead of serving it with maple syrup, we serve it with Pedro Ximenez [a rich, sweet, Spanish sherry] syrup that has a raisin-like quality to it. The PX is just warmed and has a little glucose added to thicken it into a syrup. I don’t cook it or reduce it because I want to keep the alcohol in the syrup so it doesn’t become overly cloying.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

Daikon is great in stews and is milder, sweeter, and more absorbent than turnips or radishes. Duck and turnips is a classic, but I like duck with daikon even better. It pairs well with other heavier flavors, such as pork or beef.

Medjool Dates with Maple Mascarpone, Pistachios, and Orange Blossom Water
—Monica Pope, T’afia (Houston)

Someone told me about a savory date dish they had but could only remember that it was stuffed and wrapped in bacon. This led me into the kitchen to stuff a date with chorizo, wrap it in bacon, and then add charmoula [typically made of paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, cilantro, and olive oil]. The dish just hits the mark. I also serve a sweet date dish that I stole from Judy Rodgers of Zuni Café. My version is made with Medjool dates that have maple mascarpone smeared in, pistachios crumbled on top, and orange blossom water. The orange blossom water gives people a visceral reaction because you don’t see it, but you taste it. When people have the dish, they lick their fingers trying to figure it out!
—MONICA POPE, T’AFIA (HOUSTON)

Dill adds a certain freshness and cleanness to a dish. During the winter, most of my fish dishes have dill—as well as dishes like goulash with noodles, which is served with both chives and dill for their herbal freshness.

Our paella made with duck confit, foie gras, and morels is in honor of [the late chef] Jean-Louis Palladin. We made a paella with the fat from the duck and morels, and to finish it we topped it with thin slices of raw foie gras. The foie gras would get warm from the hot rice and melt into the rice. It is an amazing paella!
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

Duck is great with fruit. We serve a duck with Seville oranges that are a little bitter. We made a puree of the pulp and a little peel that had nice acidity and bitterness. We then added fennel that had been cooked with butter and a little star anise.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

For my dish of lacquered duck and peppercress, I make a duck cooked with honey served with a brown butter–honey that gives the duck a sweet, nutty flavor. To cut the sweetness, I added a reduction of pomegranate juice and oil emulsion to give the dish a tart contrast.
—BOB IACOVONE, CUVÉE (NEW ORLEANS)

We serve a sixteen-ounce duck breast with a Pinot Noir, blackberry, and ginger sauce. The sauce is made from frozen Oregon blackberries, which I am not shy to admit I use, because eleven months out of the year, there is nothing better. At home, I make a version of this sauce with currant preserves: I sauté the duck, then add lots of fresh ginger and shallots, a few tablespoons of currant preserves, and some champagne vinegar to cut the sweetness.

Eggplant is funny. It is a subtle vegetable that can work with strong herbs like rosemary or marjoram.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

Eggplant can take on an even richer, meatier flavor when it’s enhanced with miso or tahini.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

My eggplant gazpacho really tastes like a baba ghanoush soup. We start the soup by roasting eggplant and onions. Then we blend this together with tahini, tomato water, buttermilk for acidity, lemon, and garlic. The soup is garnished with three gels made of eggplant, lemon, and onion—all flavors from the soup. I love texture—people joke with me and call me “Captain Crunch”—so at the last second, we top the soup with Rice Krispies.

I like frittata as a main course at lunch or dinner. You can simply have frittata with a soup, and it’s a meal. Frittata is like a risotto in its versatility; you can go crazy with it and add almost anything to them. I love my frittata with vegetables; asparagus, artichokes, mushrooms, onions, zucchini all work. With any variety of vegetables I would add some fresh herbs and cheese. Since the eggs are the protein, the only thing I don’t personally care for in my frittata is meat, or maybe pickled vegetables.
—ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)

We will serve the combination of poached egg and spring asparagus differently at brunch versus dinner. At brunch, we will serve sliced asparagus mixed with other sliced vegetables in the bottom of a cazuela [clay pot] with the poached egg on top. For dinner, it will be green market asparagus topped with a poached egg and anchovy butter.

People shy away from endive because of its bitterness. But a good chef will pair it with a sweet dressing.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

I wanted another element in the dish because the Kobe, escalar, and brown butter are all rich and all soft. The dish also has squash, Japanese pears, and napa cabbage marinated like Korean kimchee for just a moment. These elements add contrast, chewiness, and crunchiness.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Escarole is a bitter but sturdy leaf, and in a salad dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar, I like to add Cheddar for its sharpness and creaminess plus some crisp and refreshing apples.

Puree of Fennel Soup with Apples, Almonds, and Madras Curry
—Traci Des Jardins, Jardinière (San Francisco)

I like fennel shaved raw, with just some lemon juice, olive oil, and fennel seeds. Fennel goes well with dried meats like prosciutto. It also pairs nicely with shellfish like langoustines, lobster, or crab. Fennel can work with fish as well as with meat. It goes really well with cold poached salmon or white, light meats like chicken or veal.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Fennel is a flavor I like so much that I have to show restraint with it. You can add anything to it because other flavors really adhere to it. You can braise it in olive oil and veal stock to get one flavor. Or you can braise it in olive oil, white wine, and water and get a whole other flavor. Or you can quarter it, caramelize it, and roast it in the oven—now you have a sugar flavor and it can become a dessert. I love fennel every way including braised, caramelized, dried, candied, and pureed. In the fall, I served raw shaved fennel with arugula, and shaved Honeycrisp apple with a dressing made of apple cider, honey, and mustard. Fennel puts the salad over the top with its crunch. In summer, we serve a fennel and fig tarte tatin with duck. You get a Fig Newton flavor from the fig and Pernod flavor from the fennel; they match really well.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

Fennel pollen has a light, fennel-anise flavor with a floral component. It is delicate, so you don’t cook with it—you just finish a dish with it. It is great on lighter things like salads, poached or steamed flaky white fish, poultry, or pork. When a dish has fennel pollen, even before the food hits your mouth you will notice a floral smell that gets you thinking of summer, lighter foods, and freshness. I use it with my sea trout dish, which is served with a simple salad of green apple, fennel, jicama, pistachios, and dried gooseberries. The dish is topped with the pollen blended with some yogurt, lemon juice, and preserved lemon, which we drape over the fish. This dish just screams “summer.” With a glass of Sauvignon Blanc on the terrace in the early evening, you’re set!
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I really like fennel pollen. The majority of the time, we use it in a marinade for meats like pork, boar, chicken, and lamb. It adds an interesting herbaceous, aromatic note and a mysterious flavor.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

I love fenugreek, and its incredible aromatics. It goes well with everything from lamb to chicken to vegetables.

Think of white fish—dorade, Dover sole, pompano, skate, snapper—as white meat, and red fish—salmon, tuna—as red meat. Salmon is like pork, and tuna like beef, and both combine better with stronger flavors. Tuna even pairs with some of the same flavors as beef, including black pepper, red wine, and wasabi.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

I like my fish simply grilled or steamed. I choose fish that have a lot of flavor so very little has to be done to them. I don’t believe you need 10,000 things for a great piece of fish. Dover sole doesn’t need anything. Turbot has a wonderful flavor with no help. We get our baby octopus from Sicily and they have plenty of flavor.

—Jimmy Schmidt, at the 2003 James Beard Awards gala reception

I found a recipe for olive oil cake at the same time that I was perfecting making a foie gras mousse that was pliable to the point that it could be made into an icing. So, I created a savory cake topped with the icing. Then one day while I was online I heard someone mention Twinkies, and the next thing I knew I was ordering real Twinkie pans online. Three days later, Twinkies stuffed with foie gras was born. I serve it with fresh strawberries and black pepper. It seems like everything has been done already, but I like to think I am the only person working with Twinkies.
—BOB IACOVONE, CUVÉE (NEW ORLEANS)

Tarte flambée is a dish that is 200 years old and was originally made by farmers in Alsace in the village’s wood-burning oven used for baking bread. The tarte flambée developed from what was on hand on the farm: cheese and cream from the cow, pork from the pig, and onions from the field, which they added to some dough. Since we don’t have a wood-burning oven [in the middle of Manhattan], we have to tweak the recipe from the classic. We have to tweak the cream because if we don’t, it breaks and just becomes grease. Instead, I use a mix of fromage blanc, cream, and sour cream so I can get the same result as cream in the original. And to compensate for not having a fire, I use an applewood-smoked bacon.

Tropical fruits are strong flavored, and stand up to chocolate better. At the same time, tropical fruits like bananas or mangoes are not overly sweet fruits, so caramel can stand up to them. With tropical fruits, I will use a little lime juice and often rum as well to help give them a little kick. With mangoes, I use a little light brown sugar—or I’ll even blend light brown and white sugar together because I’ll want the flavor but not want it to be too harsh.

When garlic needs to be there, it needs to be there. That includes a lot of dishes, such as lamb. Garlic is also called for with all kinds of vegetables, sauces, pastas, and salads.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

I use garlic primarily in two ways: infused into olive oil, or served crispy as a garnish. I’ll use the garlic oil for cooking—and even if a dish will have garlic added later, I will start with this oil. For crispy brown garlic, you start by slicing it thinly like a chip. The garlic is then put into cold olive oil and cooked until it is just brown. Then, you add parsley, red pepper flakes, and an acid like lemon juice or vinegar to make a vinaigrette. You can even add some stock like a fumet, which is wonderful, too—served hot, it is great with almost any kind of fish, from something light all the way to oily blue fish.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

Cucumber and mint is a fashionable combination in cocktails, [especially] those with Hendrick’s gin, which has a cucumber flavor. Cucumber is a flavor that’s distinct yet delicate, and very refreshing. It goes beautifully with a range of foods, from Asian cuisine to smoked salmon.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

With gin, or even Martini & Rossi Bianco, I love the combination of blackberries and sage. Blackberries have an indescribable flavor to begin with, and the sage gives them a brooding quality.

I’ll use ginger more for its heat than its sweetness. For example, I’ll juice it to add to a carrot or squash puree, which gives it heat and backbone.
—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

Gingersnap-Lemon Ice Cream Sandwiches
—Emily Luchetti, pastry chef, Farallon (San Francisco)

Ginger is great on its own, but also works great with other flavors. It’s one of those “wake up” flavors that you can hide beneath all sorts of other flavors. I think it works especially well with citrus. It works with yuzu, passion fruit, coconut, banana, and other tropical flavors.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

My mom always had candied ginger in the spice cupboard when I was growing up. Today at the restaurant, we take candied ginger and combine it with whatever fruit is in season—from nectarines, to cherries, to quince—and then add Vin Santo to make a sauce for our foie gras. Vin Santo brings nuttiness and candied ginger brings spice that both cut through the fat of the foie gras. I think nectarines and candied ginger are a perfect flavor combination.
—HOLLY SMITH, CAFÉ JUANITA (SEATTLE)

Yuzu Cream, Caramelized Rice, Grapefruit, Green Tea Ice Cream, Crisp Meringue, Malted Rum Milk Chocolate Ice Cream
—Michael Laiskonis, pastry chef, Le Bernardin (New York City)

We serve a dish of grapefruit, crab salad, and mint. Grapefruit is sweet and a little bitter, which makes it fun to play with. I like mint in the dish because it refreshes and wakes your palate up. When you get a little taste of mint it brings up the other flavors of the dish.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

I love tarragon with grapefruit. It is a classic.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I have served a grapefruit and seaweed crab salad with miso dressing. I also like grapefruit with asparagus.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I never mess with the flavor of Concord grapes; I always just make them into a sorbet. I was upstate in my cabin when the first Concord grapes came into season. I wanted sorbet so badly that I cut one of my T-shirts in half to use as a strainer, and then used my broom handle with the shirt to squeeze every last bit of juice from the grapes. The sorbet was awesome!

It’s hard to even think about bitter greens without thinking about toasted nuts. You can get the flavor from the nuts themselves, or from toasted nut oils, which are balanced by the bright fruitiness of cider vinegar.

We’ll poach halibut, then serve it with a blood orange vinaigrette made with extra-virgin olive oil, which gives it a round and full flavor. The fish is then served atop a carpaccio of golden beets that have been cooked in sherry vinegar. The beets have a sweet-and-sour flavor to them. They are also very crunchy, which I like with the creamy texture of the halibut. The vinaigrette brings the right degree of acidity to the dish to make it exciting.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Halibut is a gentle-tasting fish, which leads to gentle herbs like cilantro, chives, or chervil.

—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

One of the happiest trios in the flavor world is Ibérico ham, manchego cheese, and manzanilla sherry.
—ADRIAN MURCIA, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

If you are a first timer, the only thing you should combine with Ibérico ham is the warmth of your tongue. Just let it rest on your tongue and let your 37 degrees Celsius do the rest! You can use just the fat of Ibérico ham melted in a pan and make scrambled eggs or a tortilla, and it will add amazing flavor and aroma.

Hazelnuts have a complicated flavor, though not as complicated as walnuts.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Hazelnuts are from the north and are used in Piedmontese cooking. Hazelnuts are very rich and round and buttery, so I will use them to achieve a rich, fatty quality in my dessert. Hazelnuts with chocolate are a natural. Hazelnut with grapes are great; it’s like peanut butter and jelly!
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

I am more of an herb guy than a spice guy. It comes back to a certain conservatism I have regarding food. The French are not big on spices; they use more herbs. I know the spices used in European cooking and use them in moderation. I am not going to serve a dish that is wildly nutmegged!
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

All our cooks take care of their own section of the herb garden. The garde-manger cooks [who prepare appetizers] look after the chives and chervil. The fish cooks care for the lemon herbs like lemon thyme and lemongrass, and the meat cooks for the rosemary, sage, and thyme. Our pastry cooks tend the edible flowers that can be candied, and mint and lemon verbena, which they use in sorbets.
—DAN BARBER, BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS (POCANTICO HILLS, NEW YORK)

For a lamb shoulder, if you can’t get hay, I would recommend using savory, thyme, sage, and rosemary. This technique is great for a whole chicken: slice some truffles to put under the chicken skin, brush it with butter, and put it on a bed of savory and thyme. It will be pretty incredible.
—VITALY PALEY, PALEY’S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)

I might grab honey when I am working with nutty flavors or to macerate some fruit. You can also scorch honey to create a whole new flavor; one of my favorite dishes is a burnt honey caramelized pistachio ice cream.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I use honey as a flavor, not as a sweetener like sugar. In my honey panna cotta, I add some sugar to make it sweet enough. If I used only honey as a sweetener, the flavor of honey would be too strong and the panna cotta would taste a little flat.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I like the combination of fresh pineapple topped with warm honey. I will glaze my raspberry tart with flower honey, and my apple tart with chestnut honey. Chestnut honey gives a rustic flavor that goes well with the apple.

First, grate horseradish on a microplane [a fine grater]. Coat a teninch skillet with some Ligurian olive oil, and heat the horseradish over medium heat. Watch it very closely, because the minute it starts to turn from its blond color, it is done. From there, transfer it into cold pans to cool it quickly. When it is totally cool and has its crunch, add some lemon zest and kosher salt.
—HOLLY SMITH, CAFÉ JUANITA (SEATTLE)

If it is hot outside, I make sure there are lots of salads on the menu.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

In Eastern European or Hungarian cooking, you will see a stewed or braised dish flavored with paprika that is cut with sour cream either in it or served on top so that it mixes together as you eat it. I serve rare roasted venison in venison stock with hot and sweet paprika that is essentially a goulash. Alongside, I serve creamed sauerkraut that bleeds into the sauce and gives the same effect as a goulash. Even though the sauerkraut has an intense flavor, it is still mild because it has been cooked in cream. It is not a Hungarian dish but rather a play on a Hungarian dish, and it works in the context of the subtler intensity of flavors I like.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

Tomatoes are as important to making Indian cuisine as they are to making Italian cuisine. In fact, making an Indian curry is a lot like making an Italian tomato sauce.
—MEERU DHALWALA, VIJ’S (VANCOUVER)

If my mind is in India, tamarind will be sneaking its way into the dish. When thinking of India, my inspirations are the flavors of clove, cardamom, and coriander seed. They are aromatic spices that really cut the fat of the dish, so it is not big, fat, and flabby on the palate.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I worked in an Indian restaurant as a waiter for four years. I love cooking with Indian ingredients. Everything I learned at the CIA was thrown out the window when I learned Indian cooking, which is where I picked up many techniques and philosophies. I now roast my own spices and create spice blends. I love creating my own flavor combinations. I came to love a garam masala made with fennel, cinnamon, clove, cumin, and coriander. Each of these five spices has a distinctive flavor, but combined they create one single flavor that is amazing. I will use my garam masala mixture in soups and sauces. When people ask about the dish, they always ask, “What was that flavor?”
—BOB IACOVONE, CUVÉE (NEW ORLEANS)

I only half joke that if you add rum or orange zest to a dessert, it will taste Italian. They are very common flavors in Italy.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

There are five ingredients that any Italian cook must use: 1) real Italian pasta; 2) extra-virgin olive oil; 3) real balsamic vinegar; 4) Italian prosciutto; and 5) Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
—MARIO BATALI, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Japanese cuisine is very simple. We don’t mix too many ingredients together. One of the main ingredients we use in Japanese cooking is soy sauce, for both its saltiness and umami. Soy sauce is very complex: It takes months and months to make it. Same for the dried bonito used to make dashi, our Japanese broth. So Japanese chefs find that much of the hardest work has already been done for us!

—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Kohlrabi is an underrated vegetable. I admit it has not always been one of my favorites, but it has grown on me over the years. Now, I love it. I can’t precisely place its flavor, which is somewhere between a turnip, radish, and cauliflower. But it tastes great and is really versatile. You can grill it, roast it, glaze it like a carrot, or make a gratin out of it with potatoes. We have even grated it and made a rémoulade out of it like you would with a celery root. But the best way to enjoy kohlrabi is grilled, roasted, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt. That is my favorite!
—VITALY PALEY, PALEY’S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)

Our signature wine-marinated lamb popsicles in fenugreek cream curry on spinach potatoes dish is bare rugged simplicity. You have rack of lamb that has been cooked just a few minutes. Then you have a simple sauce that is essentially just cream and garlic—and you can taste all three. We add some green fenugreek that gives an earthiness to the dish and takes it to a whole new level. It is incredibly simple. It is a dish about technique because if the garlic is cooked too long, it gets bitter. Or if you add too much fenugreek, it gets bitter and overpowers the cream. But in the right proportions, it is perfect.

I like very little lavender with quail for its savory aroma, but the key phrase is “very little”—or else it’s like eating a piece of soap!

We have lemon juice right next to the salt when we cook. Acid is the most important aspect of how a dish tastes—whether it is there as subtle punctuation or an exclamation point!
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Lemon zest adds a totally different dynamic than lemon juice. If you are making an apple crisp, if you added a teaspoon of zest it would taste very different than if you added lemon juice. The juice would make it taste tart, whereas the zest would actually add a lemon flavor component to it. For ice cream, custards, and tarts, use lemon juice. But if you are going to combine lemon with other flavors, that’s when you use zest.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Use lemon juice when you want the acid and lemony flavor of the juice. If you want the perfume of the lemon, use the zest because the skin is where you get the essential oils. I use more lemon and orange than vanilla in my cooking because they are more prevalent in Italy and in Italian cooking, and a flavor profile that people recognize as Italian.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Lemon can be used by itself or with other ingredients because it enhances so many flavors. An orange can be a little too mellow, but lemon makes flavors much brighter. Lemon is an underlying flavor as much as the star. If there is one fruit you had to always have on hand as a basic staple, it is lemon.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Ricotta-Lemon Pancakes with Blackberries and Honeycomb Butter
—Andrew Carmellini, A Voce (New York City)

We churn through preserved lemons! In the middle of the summer, we buy cases so that we can age them eight months before we use them. After six months, they are great. After eight months or a year, you see God. They become incredible just by waiting those extra few months. I make preserved lemons by feel. I primarily use salt and will add some cinnamon, clove, nigella, a tiny, tiny bit of saffron, and then just tuck them away in the refrigerator. If I wasn’t so greedy, I would give them away, but we are talking a year of my life here!
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

When you are using different kinds of lemons, you need to treat them as different things. A Meyer lemon is different from a regular lemon. If you are using a Meyer lemon, you may want the perfume, aroma, and subtlety of it. Yet when you taste it, you may want to add a touch of regular lemon to give it a little more acidity and a little kick.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

We get a lot of Meyer lemons in during the season, and they have a lovely sweet-orangey lemon flavor. But there are times that they are simply too sweet and we have to either add regular lemon or some lime to balance the Meyer lemon.

A drizzle of sherry vinegar just before you serve lentils elevates them to another level.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

I like lentils for soup with a smoked ham hock. For seasoning the soup, I recommend thyme, bay leaf, and a pinch of cumin. You can add bacon or sausage, or serve it with potato galettes on the side.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Bibb lettuce is a light, delicate, and almost creamy lettuce, so I serve it with a creamy dressing to mimic that creaminess. Because of its delicacy, to make the mayonnaise I’ll use a neutral oil that’s a blend of 80 percent canola and 20 percent olive. It finds a counterpoint in lemon and fines herbes, and gets a note of freshness, crunch, and spicy heat from radishes.

For my dish Roasted Maine Lobster in “Folly of Herbs” with Baby Fennel and Salsify, I wanted to do something different with lobster besides a lobster sauce. I make a “tea” of dried herbs: thyme, rosemary, fennel seeds, oregano, sage, mint, and tarragon. This is boiled and strained, then gets a dash of Ricard [also known as Pernod, an aniseflavored liquor]. The lobster gets finished with fresh parsley, mint, and fresh oregano. I chose these two vegetables because salsify is underused and underappreciated. I don’t blanch my salsify in water because when you do, the flavor stays in the water. I roast them and caramelize them a little bit, then deglaze with just a little water with a sprig of thyme and a bay leaf. Baby fennel is good because it plays off the Ricard and fennel. I quickly blanch the fennel and then caramelize it.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Cooked lobster meat blends well with mayonnaise, but I don’t think I’d use it with raw lobster—I’d use soy sauce instead.

Stinging nettles and lovage is a wonderful combination. Stinging nettles are peppery with a green flavor and lovage is celery-like. It’s funny: I find nettles without lovage are kind of flat tasting. I will use this combination in a ravioli filling or with local Dungeness crab as a sauce for a soufflé.

Our macadamia nut tart, which we serve with banana-rum ice cream, is our take on pecan pie.
—LISSA DOUMANI, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)

Macadamia nuts are buttery, rich nuts. I will even pair them with sea scallops, which also have a richness to them. The macadamia nuts don’t overwhelm the scallops and I put them in the dish slightly chopped—otherwise, the texture of the nut would be too chewy. We use macadamia nuts on one of the simplest yet most popular dishes on our menu—our jumbo lump crab cake with grilled asparagus and toasted macadamia nuts. Our crab cake is the only recipe we won’t give out. It contains no herbs or spices. The only thing that goes in our crab cake is crab, salt, pepper, panko [Japanese bread crumbs], and a little mayonnaise to hold them together. You are the first people to get this recipe!
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

I typically use maple syrup with nuts, like in a pecan pie. I will replace the dark corn syrup in the recipe with maple syrup instead. It is always important to use a very good quality [e.g., Vermont or Canadian] maple syrup. If you are working with syrup and sugar, you need to be careful because the combination of dark brown sugar with maple syrup can become very intense.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

BLiS maple syrup is aged in bourbon barrels, and is good enough to drink on its own! I’ll use it with everything from duck breast to foie gras.

When planning a menu, pick the dessert or the entrée first and have the other one match it, in terms of style and preparation. If you are doing an entrée that requires last-minute time in the kitchen, don’t serve a dessert that requires last-minute time as well. If you have a main course that takes last-minute work, serve a dessert that can be made a day ahead—or if your dessert is what needs last-minute attention, serve it after a stew or lasagna. When deciding what to make, remember: The heavier the main course, the lighter the dessert should be, or vice versa. I was recently going through some of my earlier books and was shocked when I looked at the recipes. One recipe for a chocolate cake that we served at Stars was served in big wedges. I was amazed we used to serve such a huge portion! People can’t eat like that anymore. At the same time, the cake is so good I still want to serve it so I work backward. I will serve a chicken or something else light for the main course, not a prime rib of beef.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Creating new dishes has to be more than simply intensifying flavors for dishes. In terms of visual presentation, we are shifting into a new direction where the food looks like one thing, but is really something else. That adds an extra element of challenge for us. An example of this would be a [Mexican-inspired] nacho dish we just created. You get something that looks like chips, sour cream, salsa verde, and grated cheese. The cheese is actually grated from saffron ice cream that we have thrown into liquid nitrogen, that is put into a food processor grater. The salsa verde is made from kiwi, mint puree, and epozote to give it a little twist. The sour cream is a yuzu crème fraîche. The chips are made from pureed corn tortilla chips that have been sweetened with powdered sugar, then pasted into triangles and deep fried. So you get something that looks like nachos, but tastes completely different. So we are taking a visual aspect of something you are comfortable with and serving it at the end of a twenty-course meal.
—HOMARO CANTU, MOTO (CHICAGO)

With mint, applemint is mild, while peppermint is strong.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

I was actually brought up in the school of thought that put a sprig of mint on every dessert. I am not that guy anymore. I have a saying—“NFG”—which stands for two things at once: “nonfunctional garnishes” are “no fucking good.” If something doesn’t make sense to the dish, it won’t be there. I hate ordering lamb and seeing a huge bunch of rosemary alongside it. Put it in the dish—let me taste it!
—JOHNNY IUZZINI, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)

I love mint flavor, but some cooks started throwing mint on desserts just because they liked the color of it. If you have a gorgeous strawberry shortcake and add some mint to it, one of two things will happen: 1) Either you don’t eat it, so what’s the point of putting it on the plate in the first place, or 2) If you do eat it, that one mint leaf will completely change the balance of the dessert. If you have a lemon tart that is mostly perfectly balanced lemon curd with a little whipped cream and you add a mint leaf to the dessert, the leaf will play havoc with that balance. So don’t throw mint on a plate haphazardly, or you’ll throw off the balance of the entire dessert.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

The first place I think of with mint is Morocco. From there, it is the Middle East. Mint and lamb is such a natural combination, as is mint and yogurt.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I don’t use mint very much, but I have a serious thing for black peppermint! You will see it in one form or another on my menu. I go to the farmers’ market twice a week and use it all summer. It is great with berries. It works best with something light like an infusion or granita. Last summer, we made a tangy lychee gelée that was served under oven-roasted Tristar strawberries tossed lightly with balsamic vinegar. On top of the strawberries, we scooped the black peppermint sorbet.
—JOHNNY IUZZINI, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)

I like to add miso to purees because it adds a rich, buttery flavor and a rich texture. I will serve broiled oysters topped with a puree of miso, pineapple, and serrano chile. I am working on miso-avocado puree as well. It is delicious, but I just haven’t found the right dish for it yet. I am also working with miso-huitlacoche soup with tofu, mushrooms, or corn.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

I love miso. I went to a Japanese restaurant and loved the miso soup. I realized that it would give more flavor than chicken broth to my onion soup. So now I make a miso broth the night before, let it sit and separate, and use the broth for my onion soup.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

I will use several different misos, depending on the purpose. I might use saikyo, a light, yellow, sweet miso, in marinades or with lighter fish like sweet shrimp and scallops that would be overwhelmed by dark miso. Barley miso is a distinctive strong, sweet miso that I’ll use with nigiri with baby squid and shiso. I’ll use wheat miso with foie gras. Sometimes I’ll even mix misos.

I don’t know the first thing about Moroccan cooking other than eating Moroccan food and owning Paula Wolfert’s book [Couscous], but I serve a lamb dish in Moroccan spices. I braise lamb shanks in cumin, saffron, and preserved lemon, with the juice being turned into a sauce. The lamb shanks are then boned and put into a cake with eggplant and molded onto a plate. This is not Moroccan cooking per se, but it suggests the flavors of Morocco.

I use this cross-cultural technique when making a veal dish with a great mustard sauce, which is a classic French dish, and the result is not a fusion dish: Take black, yellow, and red mustard seeds and toast them in butter or olive oil until they pop; then add some shallots and vermouth and reduce it. Then, add veal stock with a splash of cream and Dijon mustard. The result is a very complex sauce with a much deeper flavor, versus simply combining some cream and mustard together in the pan.

I love nuts, and put them in everything. I find that almost all nuts pair well with a lot of different things. When I am creating a dessert, I will choose my nuts geographically. For example, if I am making a Sicilian dessert, I’ll use pistachios because that is the nut they would use [in Sicily].
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

We always toast our nuts, 100 percent of the time. Nuts absorb a lot of moisture, so by toasting them you dry them out and heighten the flavor. You do need to be careful, because they burn so easily. Slower roasting is better. With a nut like a cashew, you want to roast them at 325 degrees to get them to be a nice, golden brown.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Nuts work great in adding texture, especially to creamy and/or moussey desserts. The other way to balance out richness is with some phyllo dough.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Juicing nuts is the new thing we are doing. We’ll juice almonds, hazelnuts, and—best of all—pine nuts, which comes out like pine nut butter. Juicing pine nuts is better than grinding them, because it pulverizes their fat. We put that on some local green beans with preserved lemon zest, to serve with spring onions with lamb.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Lavender works well with all sorts of nuts, including almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, and walnuts. The one nut it doesn’t work well with is chestnuts.

—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

I’ll poach everything from saddle of rabbit to guinea fowl to fish—from sturgeon, which holds up nicely, to New Zealand snapper to John Dory—in avocado oil. It gives an incredible texture and depth of flavor. I also like it with vegetarian dishes. I use it in dressings, and it seems to hold an emulsion really well. It has a nice affinity with tomato; I have made tomato water with chardonnay vinegar and avocado oil, and it makes beautiful light dressing. It also goes well with citrus like lemon, lime, or orange. Just like you like to squeeze some citrus over avocado, avocado oil works the same way in reverse.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Hazelnut oil gets mixed with cider vinegar; that is a great natural marriage. This gets tossed in our baby winter spinach with mixed herbs and frisée salad. The toasted nut quality mixes well with bitter greens.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Hazelnut oil is a wonderful autumn oil. We will use it in a dark balsamic vinaigrette served with squab. It is also very good with broccoli. If you make a broccoli soup, use this along with toasted hazelnuts. It is a delicious combination.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Truffle oil is one of those ingredients that really gets overused, so one day I decided that I wanted to do truffle oil right. We make a dressing of truffle oil, white balsamic vinegar, and whole grain mustard. We toss it over endive, crumbled blue cheese, spicy pecans, and raw cremini mushrooms. You just can’t stop eating it!

Endive and Mushroom Salad, Blue Cheese, Spicy Pecans, White Balsamic–White Truffle Vinaigrette
—Monica Pope, T’afia (Houston)

If you are finishing a dish, that is also when you would use an assertive, more full-flavored oil. I also like to use nut oils, especially those made by Jean Leblanc. They are insane; his oils are so good that after you taste them, nothing else will do! I especially like to use nut oils in the fall. I use walnut oil dressing on salads, especially those salads that accompany meat. If you make a foie gras dish with apples and endive, an addition of walnut oil would be great.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

• I use a lighter (e.g., Ligurian, Tuscan) olive oil on lighter meats like veal or fish dishes and pastas. A Ligurian olive is full and bright and is great on a lighter dish.
—ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)

• I like to use single varietal olive oil from Australia and New Zealand. Australian olive oils can be like their wines: big, pungent, and spicy. New Zealand oils have a little more depth of flavor and green grassiness.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I like Greek black olives the best. I like them by themselves, but they also work great in a chicken, duck, or lamb dish.

The onion family is the basis for every cuisine I can think of. Of course, Asian cuisines use more green onions and garlic, while the French use more shallots and garlic, but it’s the onion family providing the foundation.
—TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)

You can’t cook without onions. There is not a single thing you can do without onions. There are so many things made with onions that when people come in to our restaurant and say that they are allergic to onions, I say, “No, you are not—it is impossible. You just don’t like onions.” People eat onions all the time and just don’t know it. I remember having a conversation with [the artist] Jasper Johns, with him saying, “If truffles and onions cost the same amount of money, you would obviously choose an onion. You don’t need truffles; you do need onions.”
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

I roast onions a long, long time and use them to add a meaty flavor to soups.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

Your cooking technique alters your flavors a great deal. If you put a lot of onions in your curry but don’t sauté them enough first, you will get a sweet flavor. If you sauté the onions until they are almost burnt but not quite, your curry will have more of a roasted-toasted flavor.

I like orange zest with crab and shrimp because it gives them a sunny flavor. Lemon and lime are too strong. Orange is feminine—the lady of citrus—while lemon and lime are the men!
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

I use liqueurs such as [orange-flavored] Grand Marnier to bring out the flavors of other ingredients. When it’s done right, you don’t even know it is there.

We use lots of smoked paprika, but need to be careful because it can be really strong. I like to finish our fried chickpeas with this because it makes them taste like they just jumped out of the fire! We also like to mix our paprikas together, typically in equal proportions of sweet, hot, and smoked. Smoked paprika is primarily smoky and doesn’t have a lot of other flavors. So if you combine it with a vibrant sweet paprika, you’ll get a more rounded pepper flavor. Paprika is also very regional. In the south [of Spain] where it gets sunshine and heat, you see more smoked paprika, but in the north where it is colder and rainy, they are not into the heat.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

The Spanish use parsley stems for cooking, and fresh as a garnish before serving. When you make rice or beans, you would put a stem in. To me, parsley added to fish or shellfish makes the dish tastes more “marine,” as opposed to earthy. I love salsa verde, which is a sauce made with basically a ton of parsley, garlic, and some kind of juice like clam juice. It’s wonderful served with fish.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

People do not understand parsley; they think it is green specks. But it is wonderful with fish. If you make a straight-up linguini with clam sauce, you want a big handful of chopped parsley in there—not for the appearance, but for the taste. It is an important component in a lot of dishes and needs to be there. It can also be used as a sauce all on its own. If you sprinkle it on a steak, it will not have the impact that it would on fish. On the other hand, if you make a Maître d’hôtel butter [butter flavored with lemon juice and parsley] and put it on the steak, the parsley has a role there. On vegetables, if you make glazed carrots or pearl onions or a stew with lots of vegetables, parsley stirred in at the last moment is good stuff. As for my choice of parsley, I always use flat Italian-style parsley.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

Salsa verde is my favorite all-purpose condiment at home. I like it on fish, lamb, and steak. It is made with anchovy, garlic, shallots, olive oil, and herbs—primarily parsley, but also chervil, chives, tarragon, a little bit of marjoram, and sometimes a little mint if I am in the mood. I add the acid at the last moment so it won’t change the color of the herbs, and will choose between Banyuls or red wine vinegar, or lemon juice. If I am serving meat, I will use vinegar; if I am serving fish, I will use lemon. Even though it changes color once the acid is added, it lasts a few days. It is really good on a piece of bread or with some fresh farmer’s cheese as a snack.

When I think of the essence of peaches, it’s their smell—so I think of echoing that with the floralness of Moscato d’Asti. I’ll add acidity, sweetness, and a little fat, such as through crème fraîche.
—TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)

I try not to cook peaches, or if I do, only for a short amount of time. A peach pie never tastes as good to me as a blueberry pie, because it tastes too cooked by the time you get it thick enough. So if I get peaches, I’ll chop them up and put them on a tart shell that is already cooked instead.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I like peaches with rich, round flavors like vanilla and honey.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Japanese baby peaches are tiny peaches about the size of olives. We wanted to showcase the peaches and thought, What do peaches go with? Cream. We took that one step further and used yogurt instead. So we chose Greek yogurt, paired it with the peaches, then garnished the dish with Hawaiian pink sea salt, Greek olive oil, reduced balsamic vinegar, and micro mint. We turned the water strained from the yogurt into “air” [foam]. This is a dish that we serve as a pre-dessert and it works well because it is sweet and savory.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

Anything we put peanuts on sells! Peanuts are associated with the South, so there is a regional appeal. We had a chicken breast with sugar snap peas, white radishes, toasted peanuts, basmati rice, and spicy peanut sauce.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Peanuts are not as versatile as other nuts. They have a great flavor and are pretty generic so you can use them on a lot of things and they pair well. Milk chocolate and peanuts work really well together. Peanuts pair great with bananas, especially if you cover the banana in chocolate and then roll it in peanuts and freeze it.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Borage flowers: Eating a borage flower is like eating an oyster! It is briny. In the summer when they are in season, if you taste a couple it is reminiscent of a mild oyster.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Apples are more popular than pears because when you go to the store, pears are all hard. You buy them, bring them home, and wait forever for them to ripen. You have to have a premeditated use for pears.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I like pears poached because I’m not fond of their texture. I also make a pear tart with pears poached in lemon zest and vanilla, and then combined with custard, honey, lemon, and vanilla. It is paired with a honey grappa zabaglione and topped with grated Pecorino Toscano cheese grated over it as if it were pasta. The dish sounds a little crazy but all these flavors are classic combinations found in Italy. Pears are often infused with grappa in the north of Italy. Pears, honey, and pecorino is a classic combination in Tuscany. Pecorino goes with every flavor. Honey carries all the flavors forward.

—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Peppadew peppers, which are from South Africa, started coming to the U.S. just a few years ago. I stuff them with goat cheese and wrap them in Serrano ham before frying them. You get sweetness and spice from the peppers, saltiness from the ham, creaminess from the cheese, and crunchiness from the frying. Doing so gives them so much flavor, I don’t need to add anything else.
—BOB IACOVONE, CUVÉE (NEW ORLEANS)

I like white pepper with most white fish, and black pepper with tuna and red meat. White pepper works with halibut because it does not overwhelm the fish. Black pepper has a complex flavor and is spicy, which can be distracting. The problem with many peppers like cayenne or chipotle is that they are so strong they can burn. That is not a problem for me, but it is for our clientele. We use piment d’Espelette, which is spicy but sweet.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

You have to be careful with black pepper because it can be a vehicle to add flavor—but if misused, it will mask flavor. I might add the tiniest little pinch before a dessert gets served to punch it up. I use black pepper with fresh fruit, especially cherries.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

To me, tuna doesn’t even taste like tuna anymore unless it’s seared with my pepper mix of toasted and ground black and pink peppercorns, coriander, and star anise. The same mix is also great on beef, buffalo, and venison.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

We don’t have sixteen types of pepper here; we use a basic black Tellicherry peppercorn and a little bit of red pepper flakes. I will occasionally go to an Asian market to get a pepper that has a sweet element to it, as these also tend to have a fruitiness to them that works well in braised dishes.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Guindilla peppers are used to give heat in Spanish cooking. If you were cooking beans, you would add your parsley sprig, half an onion, garlic, carrot, and one guindilla pepper. Nora peppers are smoked, bell-shaped peppers from Catalonia used for romesco sauce. They are similar to Mexican guajillo peppers. Chorizero peppers are bittersweet. Their pulp is used in salsa vizcaina, which is a red sauce made with a lot of onions cooked down sweet, the chorizero pepper pulp, and either fish or bean stock. It’s great served on fish or tripe.

Because of the texture and unique flavor of a persimmon, no matter what you do it will always taste like persimmon pudding. I decided two years ago to stop trying to do anything else with persimmons. Why try and reinvent the wheel? To work with persimmons, you first put them in the freezer overnight to ripen, then peel and puree them. Persimmons are pretty astringent, so you need to add a lot of spices and sugar to them. The combination of allspice, cinnamon, and ginger that you see in traditional recipes is nice with persimmons, and adds an interesting complexity to the flavor.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I lived in Japan for two years where I fell in love with pickles and pickling. For pickling, I use the proportions that are common for seasoning Japanese sushi rice, though I’ll admit that there might be a sushi chef out there who might disagree with me: 9 parts vinegar to 5 parts sugar, 1 part salt, and 1 part water. Pickles are one of those things I love to have in my pantry because they are so fun to use and make so many things yummy. It is definitely one of my tricks that I keep stashed away. I like to pickle Swiss chard stems with raw beets and star anise. They are great together and work as a garnish on our Nantucket Bay scallop dish.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

I don’t even like to use the word “paprika” when referring to pimenton. It is not the same as Hungarian paprika, which is just dried pepper and doesn’t taste like anything else. The Spanish were the first to plant peppers. Our pimenton has the right touch of sweetness, bitterness, and smoke. Used in a dish it makes the dish a whole new thing. Sprinkled on octopus, it is astonishing.

—Eric Ripert, Le Bernardin (New York City)

Pineapple is 80 to 90 percent water. We’ll freeze the pineapple, then pull it out and put it in a colander, and let the juice run out of it—which has all the flavor of the pineapple. After pressing out all the juice, we’ll throw out the now-flavorless pulp, and use just the juice. You can do the same with strawberries or other fruits to obtain a clear juice, which you can use in drinks or, frozen and scraped, as fruit crystals to serve with a dessert.
—DOMINIQUE AND CINDY DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)

I like the combination of rosemary with pineapple.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Pineapple benefits from a touch of vanilla.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

You have to be careful with pine nuts because they are so strong that they will dominate a dessert. If I use even a small amount in an apple dessert, it turns it into a pine nut dessert.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Pine nuts are really fatty and luxurious, so I like to use salt with them for balance. Even in a pesto, you notice the flavor of pine nuts versus using walnuts or no nuts.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Heat [aka piquancy] can come from a grind of black pepper when you are cooking, or at the last second on top of a salad before it goes out. Heat can also come from some jalapeño in steamed cockles with ginger and lemongrass. In either case, heat adds a brightness to the dish.

A Checkerboard Terrine of Pistachio and White Chocolate Ice Cream with Blackberry Sauce
—Patrick O’Connell, The Inn at Little Washington (Washington, Virginia)

Pistachios are a distinctively flavored nut. You need to be sure that what you pair with them will stand up. They go well with raspberries but not strawberries because the latter are softer in flavor.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Pistachios look great with other nuts because you get green and brown alongside each other. They can be pretty mild so they are less about flavor and more about color and texture. Since pistachios are so mild I like to feature them solo or in a large quantity so they don’t get lost. I make a chocolate semifreddo and there is pistachio in the semifreddo, there is pistachio paste, they are on the plate, and they are in the sauce. They are front and center.

What is nice about pomegranates is that they are very flavorful but don’t have a lot of sugar in them. They also have a unique flavor that is not like anything else. It is one of the few flavors that have come around in popularity because they have made it easier to use [via pomegranate juice, molasses, etc.]. Cleaning them to use just the seeds can be a pain in the neck. However, I use the juice because it makes a great sorbet.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Pomelo is good in salads. During the summer, we will mix it with pickled ginger and a couple of other ingredients and serve it on chicken or fish.

You’ll often see what is essentially clam chowder [without the clams] used as a sauce: the combination of pork—whether it’s bacon, chorizo, or whatever—and thyme, served with potatoes and cream. It could be served with something poached or sautéed. It is a cute reworking of something that is classic.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

I like the combination of pork with fruit. With a pork chop, fresh and dried figs or strawberries would all work.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Sauces often don’t do justice to the meat they’re saucing. For that reason, we don’t use veal stock with pork, which hides the flavor of the meat. Instead, we want to do everything we can to emphasize the flavor of the pork itself. So, we’ll roast the pork scraps and bones and make a pork stock instead. In the summertime, to keep it light, we won’t even add wine.
—DAN BARBER, BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS (POCANTICO HILLS, NEW YORK)

Pork can handle all the sweet spices, including allspice, cinnamon, and clove.
—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

I’m sometimes inspired by looking back to my childhood and the combinations of flavors I liked. I was a pretty picky eater growing up, but I loved my macaroni and cheese, and bacon and eggs. I came up with a take on bacon and eggs substituting pork belly for the bacon. I love pork belly—it is a poor man’s foie gras, the way it just melts in your mouth. I make the eggs in a double boiler that gives them a creamy texture, and finish them with fresh herbs. For the belly, we grill it and then braise it in citrus, champagne vinegar, and veal stock for six hours. Then at serving, we grill it again and top it with a “sweet heat” sauce which is like a barbecue sauce with layers and layers of flavor.

With pumpkin or even sweet potatoes, the combination of allspice, cinnamon, ginger, and clove works great. If you buy canned pumpkin that has spices already added, it tastes a little off and artificial. Depending on how you like your spices, you typically add equal amounts of ginger and cinnamon and less allspice and clove because the last two are very strong.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Pumpkin and butternut squash juices are great in dishes featuring [each respective vegetable]. What the juice does is intensify their flavor, making the dishes taste more natural.

—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

Pumpkin and bay leaf together make the pumpkin taste even more pumpkin-like.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

My pumpkin pie soup dish was inspired by walking through Whole Foods and seeing pumpkins. I thought, How do I like my pumpkin? I like pumpkin pie, and thought it would actually make an interesting soup. I made a pumpkin soup and found the soup to be very savory with its spicing, and added smoked duck to it. I wanted a contrasting flavor, so I added some sweet meringue as a garnish. Then I needed a contrast to the creaminess, so I put in a piece of pie crust a second before serving as well as toasted pecans for even more crunch.
—BOB IACOVONE, CUVÉE (NEW ORLEANS)

A dish I am really proud of is our saddle of rabbit served with green olives, shallots, marjoram, and fennel jam. This is a light and beautifully balanced dish that reminds me of Liguria [in Italy]. The olives are salty, the marjoram is strong, and the fennel is sweet. This has been on our menu for over a year but it took me a few tries to get right. I tried black olives, but they were too strong. I tried rosemary, but it was too earthy. I tried Brussels sprouts, but they were a little too bitter and didn’t complement the same way sweet fennel did. So though the combination didn’t work for the saddle, the black olives and rosemary led me to add some rabbit liver and stuff a whole boned rabbit. That dish did work. The two dishes were different in the sense that the saddle with the green olives was a little more sophisticated while the whole rabbit was more of a peasant dish. Customers like both!
—ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)

It’s vital that you taste your ingredients to determine the best way to serve them. We got a new radicchio in that is so bitter it just won’t work as a salad. Instead, we will turn it into a pesto or a tiny garnish.

There is a time of year when all there seems to be in the green market is radishes. You get sick of seeing them and they are there for months. I needed to create something new and all there was were radishes. So, I came up with a radish salad served with lobster. We blanch turnip rounds and fold in a little baby ginger to get this wonderfully peppery salad. The sauce with the lobster is a pistachio vinaigrette that is bound by onion puree and brightened by the juice that pickled the ginger. We finish the dish with toasted pistachios and add a pistachio oil. The pistachio nut and oil add an earthy quality and depth of flavor to the dish.

—Michael Laiskonis, pastry chef, Le Bernardin (New York City)

When working with raspberries, I will try not to cook them too much. The problem is that often fresh raspberries are not that great. If I am making a sauce, even in the middle of summer I will use frozen raspberries. You can use frozen fruit as long as it doesn’t have sugar or anything else added. The fruit is picked in the field when it is ripe and frozen right away. So, the frozen raspberries will have better flavor than those that have been put in a little carton and shipped across the country. Of course, local farmers’ market raspberries are a different story. If I am making a sauce in the summer, the frozen raspberries will taste great. On the other hand, you would not use frozen raspberries on top of a tart.

Rhubarb-Mint Cobbler
—Jerry Traunfeld, The Herbfarm (Woodinville, Washington)

I like to pair rhubarb, caramelized sugar, and blood orange juice—which has more character than orange juice—because their seasons barely overlap. I am not a fan of rhubarb desserts because they always tend to be one note—either very tart, or very sweet to make up for the tartness. Caramel works well with rhubarb because it makes the rhubarb not too sweet.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

There is not a lot of fruit available in the spring, so that pretty much leaves you with rhubarb. The good news is that rhubarb works well in custards and ice creams.

Rose and Almond Panna Cotta

Tropical Fruit Salad with Rosewater and Sweet Tahini Yogurt
—Brad Farmerie, Public (New York City)

I tend to think in threes. I’ll pair two classic ingredients, and add a third to elevate the combination. I make my own rose-flavored dessert that was inspired by [French pastry chef] Pierre Hermé and his rose macaroon with raspberry and lychee, which is one of the greatest things I have tasted in my life. I coat a standard tart shell with a layer of liquid raspberry; on top of that I place a rose parfait, which I pair with lemon and pistachio. To make the rose flavor not so overbearing, I use it in three different forms. I infuse rosebuds [used to make rosewater] in the milk for the parfait, and I also use rose syrup, which adds color and sweetness, and finally rosewater as well. You have to be careful with rose because it can be like eating perfume. That is why I take a lot of care using three layers to make it one flavor.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Rosemary has a strong flavor, so it’s always going to be the star. It works with strong, assertive fish like swordfish or tuna—and, of course, it is a classic with lamb.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

Rosemary works with apples or pears.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

When I think of rosemary, I think of octopus. It works so well in a ceviche with octopus, black olives, and potato.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

Rosemary can be strong with seafood unless it is a full-flavored seafood. We will skewer mussels with rosemary and panfry them because they work with the piney flavor of the mussels.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

Rosemary works well with citrus and honey.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

The Martinique rums tend to be drier, while Haitian rums tend to be spicier. I use more spices with rum in general, and herbs with spirits such as gin.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

I love the combination of rum with carrots. Carrot juice provides a bright color that sends a message, especially to women. It has its own natural sweetness, and a little goes a long way. Carrots go beautifully with lemon thyme and orange, but I especially love the combination of carrots and ginger. In the autumn months, I’ll combine gold rum with carrot and apple juices and autumn spices. I’ll infuse allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a tea or tisane, and add that to the cocktail.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

Apple-Rutabaga Soup
—Patrick O’Connell, The Inn at Little Washington (Washington, Virginia)

Saffron Panna Cotta with “Agrumi Misti” and Blood Orange Sorbetto
—Gina DePalma, pastry chef, Babbo (New York City)

I would definitely have saffron on hand for Spanish cooking. It lends itself to rice, seafood, meat, and poultry. You can combine saffron and salt together for a saffron salt that is incredibly aromatic. Saffron also works very well on a salad. People forget that saffron is a flower and, sprinkled on a salad, it aromatizes the greens.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

Saffron has a sweet power. It is a classic flavor to add to shellfish, but the minute you taste the saffron in a dish, there is too much.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

Saffron has a bright metallic flavor, and with quince—which is floral, delicate, and perfumed—it is wonderful. Over the years, I have found that saffron unexpectedly changes its flavor depending on what fruit is paired with it. Each fruit I work with either turns up its floral component or its metallic flavor. Saffron is great with stone fruits like apples, peaches, pears, plums, and figs. It also works with citrus like blood oranges, kumquats, and grapefruit. On the other hand, it doesn’t work with many berries. It makes strawberries a little flat, and is downright awful with cranberries.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Sage has a much better flavor when it is cooked first. We will cook it in butter, olive oil, or bacon fat.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

Every salad should have elements of bitter, salt, heat, and texture. For us, the bitter component is often the greens. We use a lot of frisée, radicchio, and endive. But there always needs to be some crunch in a salad. Even if it is a delicate salad, you need to find a way to get a crunch in there. For a delicate salad, you can get crunch using fried shallot rings or crispy sage leaves. We often use nuts for crunch. Our leaf salad has a cashew brittle, which is made by caramelizing sugar then seasoning it with salt, black pepper, a hint of madras curry, a pinch of our Moroccan spice blend (eighteen ingredients), and a pinch of pepper mix (four ingredients) before tossing the nuts in. The other components of the salad are pomegranate seeds, bacon, and a South American blue cheese.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

When you are eating a salad, the greens are the main ingredient, so whatever you add has to elevate them. Lettuce is boring by itself, so you elevate it with the vinaigrette. We will use herbs in our salads, but they must not overpower the greens; they have to be very subtle and used in small amounts. We will use chives or fresh parsley leaves or a combination of the two. We may also add some mint to the mix because it pushes the flavors of the greens.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Salmon has been my favorite fish since I learned to cook it correctly. It is so versatile: you can smoke it, marinate it, or even serve it raw. Because it is rich and fatty, it pairs well with everything from a red wine sauce to a simple vinaigrette.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

Tomato and pineapple with salmon: This dish goes back to 1975 when someone gave me a salad of tomato and pineapple. I didn’t know what to do with it, so I stored the idea away. Today, I will cook the tomato, pineapple, a dash of white wine for acid, miso, and the salmon head, which bridges and brings the flavors together. Tomato gets fruitier when cooked with pineapple. The end result doesn’t taste like either tomato or pineapple; it is a new flavor. This sauce is perfect with salmon.

My signature sushi roll pairs salmon with mango puree and sushi rice. However, I wouldn’t serve salmon with mango puree as sashimi. The balance would be lost. Also, mango doesn’t pair well with either soy sauce or wasabi.
—KAZ OKOCHI, KAZ SUSHI BISTRO (WASHINGTON, DC)

We roast salmon wrapped in squash blossom and it imparts a slight zucchini flavor to the salmon. The blossom is mild and makes a perfect package for the salmon by steaming it as it cooks. With the salmon we serve a [zucchini] squash cut into spaghetti seasoned with lemon thyme and basil. The herbs work with both the zucchini and the salmon.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

I love combining fruit and proteins. I am one-half Hawaiian, and in Hawaiian cooking a classic dish is Spam cooked with fresh pineapple. I grew up with my father making it for us, and it is delicious. You’ll also see a lot of sushi chefs combine kiwi and scallops, as fruit adds a nice cleansing note to the protein you are working with. Our take on this combination is pineapple salmon with avocado and quinoa. We cut pineapple very thin, then wrap it around salmon belly, which is very rich. When we cook it, the pineapple gets caramelized and helps cut the fat of the salmon. On the dish is a sweet-hot sauce of avocado, honey, scallions, and serrano chiles. To garnish the dish and add some crunch we add quinoa that is cooked then dried for three days before cooking it in olive oil, which makes it puff like Rice Krispies.

I like to use Hawaiian salt on a dish where I want a little crunch. This holds up better than other salts that will dissolve more quickly. I will use it on ceviche, which has a little broth.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

We use fleur de sel on cold dishes, such as salads. We also use it on meats like beef, buffalo rib eye, or roast chicken after they are sliced and a moment before serving.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Japanese salt has ground seaweed in it and works on sashimi. I use this in Japanese dishes.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

We use kosher salt primarily for meats.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

[Maldon] is the finest of all salts in regard to both flavor and texture. I appreciate its delicacy on fish, especially lobster.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

For delicate foods like vegetables or fish, we use ground sea salt right before it goes into the pan.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

The Danish smoked salt we use is smoked over Chardonnay vines. For us, using smoked salt provides the flavor of cooking over grape vines as they do in Spain. Smoked salt is also great if you don’t have a grill, because even a gas grill can’t provide a smoky flavor. I like smoked salt sprinkled on sardines, which in Spain will be cooked over a fire on the beach where they get really smoky. I can give that sense of place by using this salt on my sardines.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

If you have a piece of Ibérico or Serrano ham in your refrigerator, you’ll eventually end up with this little end of dried-out salt-cured meat. While some might just throw it away, we know there’s a lot of flavor left—so we grind it up in a coffee grinder and use it as meat-flavored salt. We call this “ham salt,” and will use this on a salad to emphasize the aroma and flavor of pork…. In Spain we have mojama, which is tuna loin cured like ham. We’ll grind it up in a coffee grinder and it becomes tuna salt. When I sear tuna, I will sprinkle this on and emphasize the tuna with its own tuna flavor. It is simple and dramatic. I even showed this technique to the owner of the best tuna restaurant in the world—called El Campero in Barbate, Spain—where he serves tuna a hundred ways. He loved it!
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

We use three different kinds of salt—but we also use capers, anchovies, olives, preserved lemons, and even prosciutto for adding another dimension of saltiness. Even when using these other salty components, 99 percent of the time we’ll use them in addition to salt, not instead of it.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Kosher salt has larger, harder crystals and won’t break down too fast. I use this for pasta water, brining, curing meat, and charcuterie. I use French sea salt(esp. Baleine) for general seasoning. I like Maldon salt a lot. This is what I use for finishing dishes. It has a really fine crystal and the flavor is great. It even gives some crunch and melts like snowflakes. It is great sprinkled on raw fish.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Salt is now used very often in desserts and unfortunately it doesn’t always make sense. I was served a green apple sorbet with salt and it didn’t work. Salt does work on sweet oranges, though. If you cut a Cara Cara orange into wedges and sprinkle sea salt on them, they are delicious. Salt also makes sense with caramel and butterscotch. The salt is a contrast to the super sweet, which is why we like PayDay candy bars.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

I use Maldon salt flakes as a salt for finishing dishes, and kosher salt for blanching water or when I roast on salt. I’ll sometimes use smoked salt with raw fish or in a brine for pork, but it’s really strong so you have to be careful with it.
—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

There is salt in almost all of my desserts. However, you would not know it was there until I took it out—which is how it should be. You don’t need to taste the salt, but it helps open the palate and stimulates your taste buds. With something fatty like chocolate, you need some salt to brighten it up. I use all sorts of salts with my desserts. We are making a peanut butter and jelly bonbon that I pair with smoked Brittany sea salt. Maldon salt is shaved and more about texture, because it is not as strong; I would use it on a pancake or something creamy. Fleur de sel is a salt with texture and ocean floral notes, and would go well on our panini which have cheese, arugula, and vinaigrette.
—JOHNNY IUZZINI, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)

Salt goes into almost every dough we make and is something that makes flavors pop. Some chefs can go a little overboard, but desserts should still be sweet. Salt works well with caramel and chocolate, obviously. I also use a vanilla salt with a classic sweet potato tart that is cut into four slices with a few grains on each slice. The salt reinforces the savoriness of the sweet potato and plays off the brightness of the preserved lemon on the plate.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

To counteract oversalting a dish, you need to increase the volume of whatever you are making. That can be tricky, because you don’t want to end up with something too watery. Whenever there is a puree involved, whether it is mashed potatoes or butternut squash soup, I encourage my cooks to make it thick. You can always add, but not take away.

Savory in any form—whether summer or winter savory—is my favorite herb. It is not as woody as thyme, not as piney as rosemary, and not as pungent as sage. It also has the ability to stay flavorful throughout the cooking process. I like it with potatoes, with polenta, and with mushrooms. Savory and mushrooms are great. I especially like grilled porcini mushrooms with savory. I’ll grill the mushrooms then put them on a bed of savory to finish roasting them. Savory also works in a sherry or red wine vinaigrette with shallots, and is great on salads.
—VITALY PALEY, PALEY’S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)

Savory is an herb that is very compatible in the same way fresh thyme is. You could use savory in dishes that call for thyme.

—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

We offer Gulf of Maine sea scallops scented with citrus, spices, and vanilla bean, caramelized Belgian endive, ruby red grapefruit, mâche, and mint. The dish came about because I love vanilla and grapefruit. I came up with the idea that I would use dry citrus to powder my scallops. Then I realized that was just one note, so I added some spice which led to star anise, fennel, and anise seed. I sauce the dish with a beurre blanc and grapefruit syrup made of fresh grapefruit, candied peel, and fresh vanilla bean. Since the sauce has butter and cream, I had to be careful not to turn this into vanilla crème brûlée! I love caramelized endive because you have a bitter vegetable that you make sweet. We cook it in whole butter and just as it starts to brown we sprinkle in sugar. This balances the tart and sweet of the grapefruit and the sweetness of the scallops.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

Sear scallops on one side only, or else they’ll be overcooked. Accent them with coconut milk, garlic, ginger, or lemongrass. Or, puree sea scallops with cream and cook them slowly in a double boiler, which gives them the appearance of white scrambled eggs. This pairs beautifully with caviar, chopped raw onion, or truffles.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

Scallops with chanterelles and green parsley sauce is as beautiful on the plate as it is on the palate.
—HIRO SONE, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)

The dish smells so good while you’re cooking it, between the garlic, the scallops, and the duck fat. The whole thing is done in one shot. No resting, no slicing, no elaborate plating. It’s fun, and it’s delicious.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

During the winter months, I’ll turn to bourbon and brown spirits to make cocktails. But non–scotch drinkers might turn their noses up at a cocktail with scotch in the name, so I created the Scotty and Tammy—an Earl Grey tea–based scotch drink made with tamarind syrup that goes especially well with Indian food.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

The combination of ginger and scotch is explosive! I think the combination of ginger and lemon is such a welcoming flavor and can take on almost any spirit. Ginger itself is one of the most compelling scents and flavors in the world. Nothing else comes close.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

I love citrus and fruit in general with savory food because they add acidity. Fruit works really well with seafood because seafood is also sweet. During the winter, we served a seafood consommé with green apple and ginger. We added a little green apple juice in the end for the acid balance.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

Fruit works easily with shellfish. You need to be careful, though, and counteract some of the sweetness of the fruit with vinegar or a citrus juice like lemon. Watermelon works well with shellfish, and I particularly like it with lobster, shrimp, and crab.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

I love Provençal-style shellfish cooked with saffron and cream.
—HIRO SONE, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)

I love vanilla with shellfish because it brings out the sweetness. It works with scallops, lobster, or shrimp. I make a lobster-vanilla bisque that is one of my favorite soups. I also serve a scallop dish with vanilla, almonds, and orange. The vanilla brings up the sweet, the almonds add crispness to the creamy rich scallops, and the orange adds some acid. The dish also works really well with grapefruit instead of orange and gives it a tart flavor as well.
—BOB IACOVONE, CUVÉE (NEW ORLEANS)

Visually you can’t beat shiso; it is a big, beautiful leaf. It is great with fried foods, oily fish, and sea urchin, and pairs with big, robust flavors. Instead of grabbing lemon or soy sauce, you can use shiso to liven up a dish.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Shiso is a very versatile herb and works with a lot of things. It can work with pears as well as apples, not to mention a variety of seafood like Dungeness crab and spot prawns.

Shrimp shells are a base for a great sauce. They are really sweet, and you want to be sure to brown all the shrimp shell surfaces to get the maximum sweetness. This sauce came about by smelling the shells while they were cooking, and working with the flavors that came to mind. I added vanilla and whiskey, and something magical happened.

Sage goes really well with skate—it gives the skate a masculine touch.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

I make a sautéed skate dish that is basically a version of linguini with white clam sauce. The sauce with the skate is made from the juice from the clams, garlic, anchovy, and olive oil and it is finished with a parsley puree. With the fish I also serve angel hair pasta. All these flavors are what you will find in white clam sauce, but are just served in a different form.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

We used to make a garlic sage broth and I found it to be very volatile. I realized that the sauce is really only good for three minutes. After that, the sage kills the garlic or vice versa and the sauce loses its balance. What we ended up doing is making a base with chicken stock, then using a tea bag with ingredients in it to infuse the sauce, and we serve it right away. This sauce is paired with skate roasted in goose fat with green peppercorns. On the side we serve artichokes with pistachios and Parmesan cheese.

Sorrel has a green vegetal quality and is tangy. It is a little like tasting fish sauce: on its own it is nasty, but with food it is great! Sorrel also works with eggs as well as seafood. One of the seafood dishes we make is roasted oysters with bacon and sorrel sauce.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

I like galangal, lemongrass, and ginger. They all have natural acidity and zingy spice that will perk anything up. Even if you are not adding [a liquid] acid to coconut milk but add aromatics instead, your dish won’t taste heavy.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

A defining factor for American cooks is hitting high notes with acidic tones. Using acidity to create brightness in dishes stands out from the cooking I did in France. French cooking is all about harmony, while American cooking is about hitting the high notes. In American fine dining, you have to have some boundaries with your acidity because you are working with wine. It is important to hit the high notes but you have to do it without destroying the wine pairing.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Almost every dish has to have some sort of acid, or else it will taste flat. It is a question of taste—some chefs like sour, some like sweet—and there is no right or wrong. Lemon juice is used in small amounts to bring out other flavors. I use all kinds of vinegars—banyuls, red wine, rice wine, and sherry, just to name a few.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

I have a cupboard full of acids! Every culture is doing the same thing when it comes to using acid in its food: it is all about enhancing flavor without adding salt. We use a lot of citrus, whether it is lemon, lime, or something else. When I lived in England, they joked with me because I would add orange juice to almost everything, especially vinaigrettes. I really like its acidity and the light, fruity flavor it adds. On a totally different end of the spectrum is tamarind. We always have tamarind water in our refrigerator and use it to finish sauces. Depending on the country of inspiration, I will use a different acid: for India, tamarind; Japan, ponzu, yuzu; Middle East, sumac, preserved lemon, and yogurt; and for Southeast Asia, lemon, lime, and tamarind.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

I select my acids as carefully as I select my sweeteners. I could use lemon juice for everything, but in some cases, verjus will add a brightness that balsamic or sherry vinegar won’t. I love verjus and have served it alone as a sorbet. I have also served it with apple and pears. I like ice wine vinegar with roasting fruits. Aged balsamic vinegar isn’t shocking anymore—it is great straight over fruit or added to an ice cream.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

• Confit: I use this most often as a garnish.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

What sous-vide [“under vacuum”] cooking does is give you a long, very controlled cooking time. I like to use it on vegetables because no air hits the vegetable. All the white vegetables come out really white. It also keeps the whiteness in fruits like apples and pears.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

Instead of sous-vide, with poultry I’ll use a poaching technique I learned from my grandmother: I’ll cover a whole chicken or turkey or pheasant with cold liquid, mirepoix, garlic, and herbs; cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid; bring it to a boil; drop it to a simmer; and then turn it off. This technique creates a vacuum seal that transfers all the flavor into the chicken. It’s ten times better than straight poaching, because you don’t lose any moisture. I’ll serve the chicken cold with a hot ginger sauce that’s two parts fresh ginger to one part each garlic, scallions, and cilantro. I heat oil to smoking, pour it over the herbs, and serve the hot ginger-herb sauce over the cold poached chicken. It’s delicious.
—TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)

I add soy sauce to my onion soup because it gives it a meaty flavor. I use so much soy sauce at home my kid is starting to look Asian!
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

White soy sauce is something I fell in love with while cooking in Japan for two years. It is like liquid smoke. It is not really soy sauce, but more of a brewed wheat product. It has a smoky quality, too, but it is still so light you can use it on hamachi with sesame seeds and olive oil.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

White soy sauce is lighter on the palate and has a cleaner, more direct flavor than regular soy sauce. Regular soy sauce has a touch of caramel for color, flavor, and body, which makes it more a part of the dish rather than simply enhancing the ingredient. White soy sauce will let the ingredient sing. It is very pale, and if you make a ponzu sauce with mirin and rice wine vinegar, you’ll get something almost clear.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Hearts of Romaine and Treviso Radicchio with Spanish Serrano Ham, Manchego Cheese, and White Anchovies, Fire-Roasted Peppers, and Crisp Capers
—Carrie Nahabedian, Naha (Chicago)

Petite Red Oak Lettuce Salad with Manchego Cheese, Cinnamon Almonds, and Aged Sherry Vinaigrette
—Celina Tio, American Restaurant (Kansas City)

Sweet Potato, Feta, and Smoked Paprika Tortilla with Minted Lemon Raita: We looked at Spain and the tortilla as the starting point for this dish. A traditional tortilla is made all together in one pan, but we played with that a little. We roast our sweet potatoes first with spicy-smoky paprika that tempers the sweetness with the heat and aromatic smokiness. We add feta cheese for the salt factor and caramelized onion for another layer of flavor. We then mix up a bunch of eggs, combine everything together, and cook it tortilla-style in a hot pan with a lot of olive oil on the stove and then in the oven to finish cooking. When we serve it, we cut it tortilla-style in a wedge and serve it at room temperature. The idea of eggs and potatoes always feels a bit heavy, which is why there is a zesty yogurt on the plate along with a crunchy watercress salad.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Hearts of Romaine and Treviso Radicchio with Spanish Serrano Ham, Manchego Cheese and White Anchovies, Fire-Roasted Peppers and Crisp Capers: This dish is an homage to Guillermo, who supplies our Spanish products. His anchovies are so good that if someone asks for them on the side, the waiter just replies, “Trust me….” The reason there is radicchio on the salad is because I like to change people’s opinions of ingredients that have been wronged. When it is added to this salad, it is so good you can’t believe it. It adds a wonderful crunch and balances the romaine and other flavors. I add the fried capers to add some acidity and crunch.
—CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)

In Spain, eggs aren’t eaten for breakfast; they are more for dinner. The Spanish also don’t eat brunch, but at Tía Pol, brunch is a way to celebrate the Spanish egg cookery that is a huge part of their diet. The Spanish cook eggs beautifully and in a huge variety. In the Basque country, they really value a soft scrambled egg with a great ingredient in it—whether tiny mushrooms, asparagus, or baby pink shrimp. The Spanish also cook eggs in olive oil. When we serve a fried egg, we cook it in so much oil it is almost deep-fried; instead of using a spatula, we use a spider [a weblike wire mesh strainer] to remove the egg from the pan.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

Sautéed vegetables in Spain may get cooked in a little pork fat and then served with diced ham on top. The Spanish also like to braise vegetables, and will add a ham end similar to a trotter [pig’s foot] during the cooking. Any pot of stew or beans, such as garbanzos, will get ham added to it as well. What the ham end adds to what is being cooked is a little funky flavor but in a good way—like the flavor mold adds to a cheese.
—ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TÍA POL (NEW YORK CITY)

Just a pinch of spices such as fennel, coriander, cumin, and cayenne is great for finishing a sauce. Cayenne is great if you want to raise the heat level. You want to use only a pinch so that you don’t even know it is there. If you are making a French lemon sauce with beurre blanc, lemon puree, and diced lemon zest, adding a pinch of cayenne will bring up the flavor without making it spicy.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

I am sure every kitchen has its own pepper mix that is not just pepper. We have a mix that is specific for meat and occasionally for pork or tuna. It is a combination of black peppercorns, pink peppercorns, coriander seeds, and toasted ground star anise. The other thing I always have next to me is a tray we call “the four seasons”: fleur de sel; red pepper flakes—the ultimate marriage of heat and fruit; dry mustard, which I use all the time; and sumac, for an acidic component.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

To counteract overspicing, you need to increase the quantity of whatever you are making. This is a case where you might want to add a puree of something, or add some sweetness because sweetness balances spice. With an Indian curry that is too powerful, you could puree some dried apricot into it. The apricot puree adds sweetness, binds the sauce, and increases the overall quantity.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Warm Mushroom and Baby Spinach Salad with Black Bean Sauce
—Kaz Okochi, Kaz Sushi Bistro (Washington, DC)

Spinach and Walnut Cannelloni in the Style of the River Plate Region, Creamy Manchego and Parmigiano-Reggiano White Sauce, and Tomato Sauce
—Maricel Presilla, Cucharamama (Hoboken, New Jersey)

I love spinach. It is best sautéed in a little oil, because if you blanch it, it tends to lose its flavor [to the blanching water]. I like to add some garlic to it, and from there you can go almost anywhere. Sautéed spinach is delicious with a poached egg.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Spinach and bacon is simply a great combination. The key to our creamed spinach is that we steam our fresh-leaf spinach just until it wilts, then drain it and chop it slightly. [In a pan,] we start with a little butter and flour to thicken, then add cream, nutmeg, and an onion piqué [an onion spiked with cloves], and reduce the cream by half. Then we add the barely cooked spinach to the cream and heat them together briefly so just a little juice infiltrates the cream. You end up with velvety spinach, which we top with [chunks of] Nueske’s bacon, which is an applewood-smoked bacon from the Midwest.
—MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)

Our warm mushroom and baby spinach salad with black bean sauce works so well because of the garlic, which is the last thing added to the dish. Too often, garlic is overpowering. You want to add just enough.
—KAZ OKOCHI, KAZ SUSHI BISTRO (WASHINGTON, DC)

Spring is when people are looking for all the young salads that they have been missing all winter. I really look forward to asparagus that I will serve simply with mayonnaise or a mousseline.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Spring is when everyone’s moods start to lighten. It may be cold, but people are looking for lighter things. This is rhubarb and strawberry season. Citrus plays a bigger role; in the winter, it is an alternative to chocolate, but in the spring, it is the lighter and more aromatic option.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Spring lamb is one of the quintessential dishes of spring.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

You may be thinking about licorice but don’t want a licorice sauce. So you may simply just grate some fennel over squab and you get this great aroma and when you take a bite you’ll taste this root beer–Pernod flavor that is not overbearing that will still work with squab, foie gras, medjool dates, and green peppercorns. Some flavors are meant to be just a soft accent on a dish. I like to think of them as “eye shadow”!

When winter squash is at its peak, it is already sweet, and yet the tendency is to want to reach for the cinnamon or maple syrup to season it. To keep it a savory dish, I’ll reach for fresh ginger, which adds a sweet heat.

Strawberry-Rhubarb Shortcake with Crème Fraîche Ice Cream
—Patrick O’Connell, The Inn at Little Washington (Washington, Virginia)

A note about the strawberries is that I cooked them on very low heat. It comes from the idea of gentleness, slowness, care, respect for the ingredients, and, in the end, a better-tasting fresh ingredient. I could have extracted more juice from the strawberries by bringing them up to a boil with a bunch of sugar, but that results in cooked strawberries and not the fresh strawberry flavor you’re after.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

A tiny bit of vanilla makes strawberries yummy! It has to be just a little because you don’t want a vanilla-strawberry dessert; you want a strawberry dessert that has a little vanilla on the palate that people have to search for.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

You still can’t go wrong with a classic. For years I tried to come up with the end-all be-all strawberry dessert. Four years ago, I said forget it—the strawberries I get from my purveyor in the farmers’ market are perfect. Now, I serve strawberry gelato with lots of strawberries and 25-year-old balsamic vinegar. It became an injustice to try to do anything else with the perfect strawberries I was getting.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Strawberries pair beautifully with Cabernet Sauvignon, and black pepper takes the combination even further.
—LISSA DOUMANI, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)

When I taste strawberries at the store I close my eyes and ask, Is this a [perfect] strawberry or does this need a little help? If they are a little dry, to help them, you cook them on top of the stove a little and that will release their perfume and juice. You can add Grand Marnier or Kirsch, which will help their flavor as well. If you follow these steps, though, this will lead you to wanting to serve them warm. If you chill them down, they will not look great. So I would serve a warm berry compote over vanilla ice cream. If you have some berries that aren’t perfect, with a little love and attention they’ll adapt. In spring, when the strawberries are early and not that good, I’ll roast them in the oven with red wine, balsamic vinegar, sugar, corn syrup, and water, and they turn wonderfully jammy.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

I love fresh strawberries with dense and dry cow’s milk cheeses, such as Queso de los Beyos from Spain. It hits your tongue like dry plaster, then melts, releasing its slightly sour fresh milk flavor. Both also go very well with rosé Champagne.
—ADRIAN MURCIA, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

Strawberries have a rose note to them so I find rose geraniums bring that out. The two have similar flavors.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

We rely a lot on sumac, which I love because it is a good way to add another layer of tartness and acidity to a dish without having to add liquid. I could not imagine our beet salad without it. Sumac works well with chicken, vegetables, and salads, as well as in a vinaigrette or with cheeses you might marinate like feta. I avoid it with red meat or steak; I think it is the wrong kind of tartness for them.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Sumac’s distinctly sour flavor and reddish-purple color can both lift a dish.
—LISSA DOUMANI, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)

If my mind is in the Middle East, I will be reaching for sumac or preserved lemon or yogurt. I use sumac at the very end of the cooking process to enhance the acid already being used in the dish.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

My favorite fruit to work with is a toss-up between all of the stone fruits [i.e., cherries, plums, apricots, nectarines, and peaches]. Late July, August, and September is my favorite time of year!
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

When I compose a dish, I work with the season—but like to play with that as well. People will ask how we can have braised short ribs on the menu in summer. I can, because I play with the other elements of the dish. For example, I pair seared watermelon with my short ribs for a refreshing note. From this base, I add other elements to lighten the dish further. The dish also has watermelon radishes that are bright green on the outside and red on the inside so you get another take on “watermelon on watermelon.” The radish also adds a little heat and freshness to cut the richness of the short ribs. The last note in the dish is feta cheese, which adds overall creaminess and goes back to the combination of watermelon and feta that you see in Greek restaurants.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

What I like about working with the seasons is that everything that is in season at the same time works together. During the summer when you have tomatoes, melon, and basil, you can make a dish with them and it will work. [His menu includes a salad of grilled watermelon with tomatoes, basil, and aged balsamic.] I don’t try to create new combinations of ingredients. I saw the combination of tomatoes and basil everywhere I ever worked. Should I do something different with tomatoes? No—why? The reason everyone serves this combination is because it is amazing! My approach is to find a new way to serve the tomatoes or the basil. I may make a tomato gazpacho and serve it with basil sorbet, or I could serve different preparations of tomatoes on the plate—fresh, a confit, a juice—and then do the same with the basil, serving it as an oil or a puree.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

Look at the weather and the occasion. You want your dessert to match the style and appropriateness of the meal. If it is a barbecue in the summer, I would serve a fruit crisp or pie, summer pudding, or ice cream, and that is pretty much it. People always talk about using fresh and local ingredients, which is very important. But, if you are using chocolate, which is available year-round, and if it is 85 degrees out with 85 percent humidity, the last thing you want is a hot chocolate soufflé. You want chocolate ice cream instead.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Summer vegetables work with summer herbs. In the Northwest, you will see the same set of ingredients in season in the same week every year. So, you just put them together. For example, sockeye salmon comes into season [during the summer] when squash does, and so do the herbs used in a fines herbes mixture. There’s your dish!
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

In the fall, I use walnut vinegar which is red wine vinegar with macerated walnuts in it. It is great on a sweetbread and hazelnut dish.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Sweetbreads, Cauliflower, Burnt Bread, and Toasted Hay
—Grant Achatz, Alinea (Chicago)

At dessert time, you don’t have the same philosophy as you do at the beginning of the meal. You don’t want people coming back for more—you want to finish them off! Dessert is the easy course, because sweetness is easy and obvious. I don’t want big structure; the work is done. As long as the apple tastes like apple, you are there! A dessert is about manipulating the sugar in some way to bring out the best of the apple, chocolate, lemon, pecans, or whatever you are working with. From there, you want to balance the sugar with the fat to bring out the best of the star ingredient. I am not a pastry chef, so I try to stick to simple things, like chocolate pot de crème and lemon pudding. The key is that, though they may be simple, I always use very good ingredients.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

I’m not such a fan of white sugar because it only adds sweetness and little sophistication. Maple, honey, or brown sugar add so much more. When making a baba in France, you use only sugar and water. I use molasses because it gives texture and sweetness. In France you use a lot of simple syrup. I like to use orange juice instead of water, and instead of using white sugar, I’ll use brown.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

I love jaggery [the unrefined sugar used in India, also known as palm sugar] because it has a fermented flavor and provides more complexity. Dates can be a primary source of sweetness in a dessert instead of sugar, as can vegetables such as beets, carrots, parsnips, and corn, which all have an earthy sweetness. However, I don’t want to pound people over the head with a beet sorbet.

The flavor of tarragon is fabulous. You get the flavor of Provence and of fennel… it is wonderful. I use it a lot, but you have to be careful. Most people chop tarragon too thin and it oxidizes before it goes into the dish. You want to just cut it into three pieces, and that’s it. Chop, chop, chop—that’s it. Otherwise, between the knife and the cutting board, it will oxidize and give the herb a bad taste.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

I like tarragon when it is used in moderation. It is a fairly particular and strong herb, and for that reason it doesn’t have the same applications as other herbs. It is good in a lot of things, such as with fish and chicken—and you can’t make béarnaise without it!
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

Tarragon is my all-time favorite herb. I like the licorice flavor and the light perfume of the herb. This is an herb that marries well with other flavors. We serve a dish right now of flounder, white corn, and sugar snap peas with tarragon butter that is delicious.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Tarragon is best on its own [as opposed to combined with other herbs],… Tarragon works with muskmelon.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

We believe that food preparation is 60 percent ingredients and 40 percent technique.
—DOMINIQUE AND CINDY DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)

I find it a bit of a nightmare to find quality fruit and vegetables in this country. I think that for this reason technique began to be the primary driving force for a new dish.
—HESTON BLUMENTHAL, THE FAT DUCK (ENGLAND)

Thyme works well with so many things, especially soups and stews. I can’t think of anything that it wouldn’t work with if used properly. It is often a supporting-role herb and not the star; it is not an herb that bangs you over the head.
—DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)

This is one of those cases where I remember the first time I ever tasted thyme. I’d ordered a cup of real clam chowder in Newport, Rhode Island, and found out that fresh thyme was the secret to it being the best I had tasted at the time. I still use thyme in my chowder to this day, though now I use dried thyme. You would have to use a considerable amount of fresh thyme to get the flavor of the dried.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Thyme works well with citrus and honey.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

In Spanish cooking, thyme is used very lightly. You will just toss a sprig in something. You don’t want it to be strong; it is just a note. I use it when making escabeche [marinated poached or fried fish] or when cooking beans.

Tomatoes with watermelon is a simple, refreshing, and perfectly balanced combination. The acidity of the tomatoes is a counterpoint to the sweetness of the watermelon.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

A romesco sauce combines some of Spain’s best-loved ingredients: tomatoes, peppers, onions, bread, and almonds.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

Strattu is a Sicilian tomato paste that I’m finishing many dishes with now. It is delicious and very sweet. It looks like red Silly Putty and comes in jars, and doesn’t taste anything like canned tomato paste. I recently used it in a garlic aioli that we served with calamari. It gave the mayonnaise a wonderful color, sweetness, and depth of flavor.
—ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Gazpacho is awesome. As a restaurant chef, I can’t just make gazpacho. I have to do something that you can’t do at home, but that is interesting—and not in a weird way. We use the ingredients that you would find in gazpacho but instead of using only tomatoes, we will use 80 percent strawberries and 20 percent tomatoes. My gazpacho is made up of toasted country bread, cucumber, bell pepper, a little garlic, strawberries, tomatoes, olive oil, and white balsamic vinegar. The dish is then garnished with Hawaiian blue prawns, diced strawberries, and slices of guanciale (cured pork jowl), olive oil, basil, and black pepper.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

My parents had a large garden with almost 120 tomato plants. I would go out in the garden and pick a tomato and eat it like an apple. I love heirloom tomato season. I like to serve them with a little salt and pepper, a drizzle of lemon juice or cider vinegar, and a piece of mozzarella cheese. You need to taste your tomatoes before you season them. Yellow tomatoes are pretty sweet, which is why I like to add a little vinegar.

I really look forward to truffle season. I love a poached egg with truffle, or a truffle salad. A truffle needs to be the central component and the dish needs to be simple. One of my favorite dishes is Jerusalem artichokes with a poached egg and shaved white truffle. We serve this in a [mason] jar that clamps on the side, and when you pop it open you get a burst of truffle aroma.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

When you have a nice ripe truffle, it will have a sweet, fruity pear smell to it. I mix pear and truffle together to make a little salad. I make a sauce with chicken stock, olive oil, and add little bits of tarragon, then serve it with langoustine, which is a very sweet shellfish.

Bluefin Tuna with Spicy Miso
—Charlie Trotter, Charlie Trotter’s (Chicago)

One dish that we always make the same is bluefin tuna over braised veal cheeks. It is our take on vitello tunato. This dish has to be made with bluefin because it is meatlike and gets seasoned like meat. The fish is cooked rare and served with a little tunato sauce and arugula.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

When I create a dish, I start with the fish and ask, What is the inspiration of the moment? I will choose a culture and start there. For a recent dish, I was in a Japanese mood and wanted something light and refined. I used a piece of turbot and paired it with miso and mushroom broth. The mushrooms don’t relate so much to the culture but the miso definitely does. I created a lemon miso paste with white miso and lemon confit. The fish would sit on the paste and at the last second the waiter would add the mushroom broth. If you add the broth too soon, the miso kills the mushroom flavors.
—ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Turbot is a beautiful, delicate fish that calls to mind special occasions and celebrations. It poaches well, and takes on richer garnishes such as caviar or truffles.
—BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)

When you get in fresh turbot, you automatically think of pairing it with delicate flavors. It is like looking at the Queen of England: You look at it with unbelievable respect, and there is no way you are going to overload this delicate piece of fish. I like turbot with a nage with periwinkles, chervil, and parsley puree. Or I’ll make it with tiny pearl onions with a drizzle of red wine reduction made from the bones of the turbot.

Fresh turmeric gives you fruitiness and upfront flavor, plus a touch of acid that perks up a dish. If you add fresh turmeric to your curry, you will make a world of difference. When you smell the powdered stuff, it smells like nothing. Dried turmeric hurts me. It hurts the soul. It is really not what turmeric is. Unfortunately, frozen turmeric isn’t a good substitute, either. You have to use it fresh.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Turmeric is always the first spice I add to a curry, like the primer on a canvas. The amount of turmeric controls the entire path that curry will take. I cook in layers of flavor, so only when I am happy with the aroma of one layer will I then add ingredients to create the next layer. If I am making curry, the pan will have onions, garlic, and tomatoes, and then the very first thing to go in is the turmeric. If I use a lot of turmeric, it’s destined to be a richer-spiced curry, as I’ll also have to put in more of all the other spices to balance the flavors.

Vanilla Bean Bavarese with Brown Butter and Laurel

—Emily Luchetti, pastry chef, Farallon (San Francisco)

I always overlooked vanilla when I was growing up. After I made my first vanilla ice cream, however, it was no longer just “the white one”! I like the nuances that different kinds of vanilla offer. Working at Le Bernardin where quality is paramount, for our ice cream it has to be Tahitian. When vanilla is the star, this is the bean you choose. It has an interesting woody, cherrylike flavor to it that I just love. Bourbon vanilla is a great workhorse bean that does well in a supporting role.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

If I poach a pear, I will always add vanilla. Vanilla also pairs really well with sweet herbs, especially tarragon and bay leaf.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

So many dessert recipes call for vanilla that it is like salt for dessert. But sometimes it doesn’t have a place and can muck up things. Vanilla should be the star of the show. I love vanilla in dairy desserts. I do a vanilla bean Bavarese (an Italian Bavarian cream) that I serve with brown butter and bay leaf. Vanilla and fresh bay leaf bring each other alive, it is a fantastic combination. Bay leaf is very sweet; it is like a truffle in that it is more about the aroma than the flavor.

All year long, I make a pistou [a vegetable soup seasoned with basil, garlic, and olive oil]. However, it changes not only by the season, but by the week. In the spring, I’ll add peas. In the summer, it will have zucchini and basil. In the fall, I’ll add salsify, scallions, and leeks, and in the winter, broccoli and even soybeans along with parsley.
—DAN BARBER, BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS (POCANTICO HILLS, NEW YORK)

Root vegetables are so sweet and full of sugar in the fall. Fall and winter vegetables thrive on cold and frost. The plant’s water converts to sugar and when it is picked you have a really sweet vegetable. A root vegetable, like a sweet carrot or parsnip, is similar in sweetness to fruit, so you can put the two in a salad and they will go well together.
—DAN BARBER, BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS (POCANTICO HILLS, NEW YORK)

Because venison doesn’t have much fat, you need to be careful how you cut its richness. I will use chutney that has nice fruit acids with the addition of a little vinegar.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

We offer venison medallions with huckleberry sauce and glazed pears. Venison is a pretty sweet meat. Huckleberries are found in the woods and pears are autumnal. The pears are poached with star anise and cinnamon, and then they are roasted to caramelize them a little, which adds extra depth to them and to the dish.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

One of my favorite dishes is medallions of ranch venison, huckleberries, roasted chestnuts and Brussels sprouts, celery root, and Honeycrisp applesauce. I love a sweet flavor with venison. A traditional marinade is with vinegar, red wine, herbs, and juniper berries. A natural pairing would be roasted pears or apples.

I use a variety of vinegars and right now I am using cider vinegar, balsamic, and white balsamic. What vinegar you grab really depends on how far you can push the product. When we make a walnut sauce, it can handle a good-sized dash of cider vinegar. In a fluke tartare, we’ll only use a drop of vinegar.
—MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)

High-quality vinegars such as Gegenbauer vinegars [from Vienna, Austria], have a place in my kitchen. I’ll use a few drops of cucumber vinegar with cucumbers, a raspberry vinegar with raspberries, and a tomato vinegar with tomatoes to intensify the flavor of the ingredient.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Balsamic vinegar is wonderful with fruit. I love the Italian dish of strawberries with balsamic vinegar.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

I like white balsamic vinegar because it has fruitiness and a hint of sweetness to it, but not aggressive acidity.
—DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)

I’ll use Banyuls vinegar as our everyday vinegar for finishing dishes. A crispy fish like ivory salmon served on the rare side will get a drop of Banyuls vinegar right before it goes out to the table. I’ll also use it as a delicate finish for birds like quail.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

We finish most of our jus for meat dishes with cabernet vinegar. If you use it at the beginning of the cooking process, it cooks out because it is so light.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Sorbet is about pure flavor and should be a very intense experience of the fruit’s flavor. You can jack up the flavor of your sorbet by choosing the correct acid to balance it. For example, lemon juice is really strong. If you have sweet sorbet, you can add a ton of lemon juice that will balance the sweetness but give you a lemon dessert. For some sorbets, I prefer to use champagne vinegar. It is light and easy to use. Vinegar is a more potent fruity acid, so you can use less and bring up the fruit of your dessert. I use champagne vinegar for mango or raspberry sorbet. It is made from grapes, which are berries, and is a natural for berry desserts—berries with berries.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Most of our ingredients are pickled with cider vinegar and a touch of sugar. I like its fresh green appley flavor and the way it makes things pop.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Chardonnay vinegar is a sweet acid, so you don’t have to add additional sugar to your pickling mixture.
—BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)

Inniskillin ice wine vinegar is really delicious, but expensive. It is delicious with foie gras. It is a fairly reduced sweet and sour vinegar and works as just a drizzle on a plate. It is also good dressed on a salad that you would serve alongside a foie gras terrine.
—TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIÈRE (SAN FRANCISCO)

Minus 8 is an ice wine vinegar, so named because the grapes are frozen to minus 8 degrees and then squeezed to make the vinegar. It still has acid to it, but it is more viscous, sweet, and tart. It is great with foie gras.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Red wine vinegar is my workhorse vinegar for cold dishes. I use it in dressings and marinades.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

The minute sherry vinegar is added to a dish, the music gets turned up. It’s not just its flavor, but its aroma as well. It makes things sizzle. It is not just when it is used in salads, but it is also the spark that makes gazpacho the unique soup it is. It is the spark that makes a humble lentil stew made with carrots, garlic, onion, and water a new thing. At the end, you add just a touch of vinegar and you have this wonderful flavor that sparkles…. We have made sorbet out of sherry vinegar and what you get is something that makes “the king of refreshing” even more refreshing! You can go either savory or sweet with this sorbet: You could serve orange segments with the sherry sorbet on top, a touch of olive oil, an anchovy, a couple of black olives, and you have a salad. Or you could take the same oranges, add a touch of honey on top, manchego cheese, the sherry vinegar sorbet, and have a sweet dessert.
—JOSÉ ANDRÉS, CAFÉ ATLÁNTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)

For our meat dishes, we deglaze with vinegar or verjus—and most often it will be sherry vinegar. That’s my workhorse vinegar for hot dishes.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

There is a range of sherry vinegar from light to heavy, and I use them all. I love sherry vinegar on almost all vegetables, but especially asparagus and cucumbers.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

Vincotto is a byproduct of balsamic vinegar, and is sweet and sour. It is very syrupy and good drizzled over fruit or cheese.
—SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)

Using vodka as a base spirit in a cocktail makes it drier, while propelling flavors and knitting them together…. I love the combination of Chopin vodka, carrot juice, lemon thyme. If I have it, I’ll use Farigoule—a liqueur from Provence made with wild thyme—and lime.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

I love to draw on the roots of a spirit, and to link a cocktail back to the foods of the table of their country of origin. I’ll pair [Eastern European] vodkas with the flavors of the zakuski table [which historically features several small dishes of beets, cabbage, eggplant, and mushrooms], such as beets, caraway, and horseradish.
—JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)

Walnuts are my favorite nut. I like their bitter quality. They pair well with honey, apples, and pears.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Walnuts are not as versatile as other nuts. If you look at its flavor, it is the opposite end of the spectrum from a macadamia nut because it has a more complicated flavor. You are not getting something that is buttery that coats your palate; you are getting more nut flavor. I can’t think of many times when you wouldn’t use it, but you might use a smaller amount.
—MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)

Walnuts are an oilier nut but still not as strong or dominating as a pecan. I like to combine walnuts with maple in desserts. They work with apples as well as pears or quince.

I thought the combination of watermelon and feta cheese sounded horrible when I first heard it. Then I tasted it, and it works.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Lemony herbs like basil or anise hyssop work with watermelon.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

I started working on my watermelon salad years ago at Jean Georges restaurant. It started out as a watermelon and goat cheese salad for summertime. The dish was a very refreshing summer dish with the rich goat cheese and the fresh sweet watermelon. You felt like you were eating in a garden! It then went on to become watermelon with fresh tomatoes, but I still wasn’t happy with it. The texture of the tomato didn’t work with the texture of the watermelon. I then turned the tomatoes into a confit, cooking them in the oven over two hours with olive oil to concentrate their flavor. The dish is now watermelon, with a layer of tomato confit, topped with pistachios that just get browned in the oven, then a drizzle of olive oil and salt and pepper. The whole thing is then flashed in the oven for just a minute or two to warm it. Just before serving it gets a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. It is not only a beautiful play of flavors, but of colors as well.
—GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)

Winter vegetables work with winter herbs. Sage and rosemary work with potatoes and root vegetables.
—JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)

I think of beef and pork as winter meats.
—MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)

With my desserts, I focus on chocolate all year round, but use it even more in winter. In California, the fruit is so wonderful in the summer that that is the place to focus. In summer, I can write my whole menu and forget chocolate—that is how good the fruit is here! In winter, it is the opposite. There are not eight unique things to focus on. So chocolate comes into play because it is a real comfort food and warming, too. Winter with its cool nights becomes soufflé season. Winter is when all the special citrus fruits are available. Thank God for that, because you can work with Cara Cara oranges, lemon, and tropical fruits like passion fruit. Mangoes are available year-round, but winter is when I use them because there’s no competition from berries and other summer fruits. What is great about the tropical fruits in winter is that they also bring color to the menu. Pies and tarts work year-round because you can put anything in them, from chocolate to fruit.
—EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)

Yogurt with Caramel, Aged Balsamic, and Pine Nut Brittle
—Gina DePalma, pastry chef, Babbo (New York City)

One of my favorite desserts is Greek yogurt, warm caramel sauce, and aged, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar. The yogurt is really rich and not too acidic. On the yogurt, I put a salty pine nut brittle, and then the drizzle of vinegar. It works because of the beautiful balance of salt, sweet, and acid.
—GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)

Fresh yuzu is expensive, so I use yuzu juice to add acid to a dish. It is great on seafood. It is not as pungent as lime, and has a little sweetness to it. When you put it on something hot like fish, it also brings out its floral notes.
—KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)

I had just come back from Japan and was inspired, so I made a yuzu curd served with green tea ice cream. The dish has some small bit players like segments of grapefruit which I have always liked with green tea. When you have a perfect grapefruit, it is a little bitter and sweet, just like green tea. Grapefruit reinforces the yuzu because though it is citrus it is a very different flavored citrus. I’ll be honest—it looks cool as well, with the pink and green being served together. For texture I add caramelized Rice Krispies. This makes it a homage to Japan: You have rice, green tea, yuzu, and a little ginger caramel.
—MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)

Just like the lemon that is often served on the side with grilled fish, just a splash of yuzu juice makes a lot of things delightful. I love both its aroma and flavor with lighter fish, such as flounder, fluke, and scallops. I recently went to a restaurant where a young chef was trying to be creative, and he paired sweet shrimp with scallion oil, which hid the flavors of the shrimp. I tried to politely suggest that he try yuzu juice instead, which would bring out the sweetness of the sweet shrimp.

Yuzu Green Tea Tart with Lychee and Green Tea Marshmallows
—François Payard, Payard Patisserie and Bistro (New York City)

My wife was the inspiration for my zucchini dish. She makes a fantastic zucchini soup. She peels the zucchini and boils them in water, then purees them with a little of the water and adds a white cheese like goat or Philadelphia [cream cheese], then some olive oil and salt. It is amazing! It is creamy, velvety, and refined. We cook the zucchini and use the cooking water to make a gelatin. Then we take the white zucchini meat and make a mousse with olive oil. So the bottom of the dish is the mousse, then a layer of seeds—cleaned one by one, which is very labor intensive—then a layer of gelatin that is topped with Spanish caviar. The dish is sweet and savory, and we are proud of its simplicity [of taste].
