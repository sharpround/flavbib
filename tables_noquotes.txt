I make an apple confit of thinly sliced apples with cinnamon caramel powder layered between the apples and baked slowly. When the dish is served, next to the apples is a small pile of dates poached in syrup with vanilla. The other flavors on the plate are lemon confit, quince, raw apple with apple cider gelée, and ras el hanout (a Moroccan spice blend).

If you stay in the boundaries of what people think a dessert should be it gets very hard to do something new. We explain that they already eat carrot cake. We think parsnip will work instead of carrot and that kabocha squash will work instead of pumpkin in a pie.
When people see eggplant in a dessert they automatically think it will not work. You have to hide the unusual element and play up what people know already. The boundaries are limitless when you think of all the crossovers between sweet and savory. Duck à l’orange is a fruit and meat combined, so why not use bacon in a dessert? A pancake with maple syrup and bacon on the plate is really sweet and savory. So people already eat these combinations unconsciously.



I have always been very fond of chef Frédy Girardet [who earned three Michelin stars at his restaurant in Switzerland before retiring in 1996]. When I was young, I cooked almost every recipe from his book and visited his restaurant. One of his most interesting desserts was an apple dessert made of apples in the shape of little balls. The dessert broke away from cooking apples whole in the traditional way, which alone inspired me. He cooked them over a very high heat for two minutes and put them into a red wine reduction that had cinnamon, orange peel, and sugar. This was put onto a sheet tray that needed to be shaken for an hour so the apples would not dry out. The apples would absorb these flavors like a sponge and would then be served with vanilla ice cream.

Daniel Humm of New York’s Eleven Madison Park on Making Asparagus Soup


Making and seasoning soup is one of the best ways to learn about flavor. Let’s make asparagus soup:


• You need a lot of asparagus flavor.
• You need acidity.
• You need sweetness that will come from the asparagus.
• You need the right amount of salt.
• You need just the right amount of spice, so that it doesn’t actually taste spicy. We use a lot of cayenne, but you would never know it is there; it is just an accent.
• You need fresh lime juice to finish.



Soup is a play of balance when you have a lot of flavor. You can add a lot of salt and it won’t taste salty. You can add a lot of acid and it won’t taste acidic. But you still have a bold-flavored soup. It’s like winemaking; at some point, there is a balance of all the flavors.
The first thing you need to do is get all the asparagus flavor into the soup at the start. We save our asparagus liquid from all the asparagus we cook to use for asparagus stock.
Making the soup: We sweat the asparagus [that is, cook it over low heat in a little fat, generally in a covered pot or pan] very slowly. When we add wine, we do it multiple times, adding a little at a time and reducing it, then repeating the process. What this does is concentrate the flavor at each step. It makes a big difference [before adding the asparagus liquid].
Finishing the soup: A soup may taste seasoned, but it still needs to be “woken up.” You taste the asparagus, but maybe it doesn’t blow you away at first. To do that, you need acid and cayenne. We season the soup with lime because it is a stronger acid and yet has less flavor than lemon. If I use lemon to get as much acid as I need for the soup, I will need to use so much that the soup will taste lemony instead.

When I think of autumn, I think of apples, pears, quince—which is so underrated—figs, and pumpkins.
I work with apples and pears, which you can start using in September, especially with the early apples like Gravenstein in the Bay Area. I try not to use pumpkin until close to Halloween, because no matter what you do with it, it will still taste like pumpkin. It’s not like berries or apples that you can do a thousand things with. As a pastry chef, if I serve pumpkin too soon, people will get sick of it—and if I take it off the menu, there is nothing to replace it with. So I try to wait so I don’t peak too early.
Figs are great for fall. The problem with figs is that there are not that many fig lovers out there. There are a lot more peach, chocolate, and apple lovers than there are fig lovers. When I make a fig dessert, I’ll pair it with a raspberry or late summer fruit so it’s more likely to meet with customer acceptance.

BALANCE


Tips: Seek balance in every dish you make:
• tastes (e.g., sourness vs. saltiness; sweetness vs. bitterness)
• richness (e.g., fat) vs. relief (e.g., acidity, bitterness)
• temperatures (e.g., hot vs. cold)
• textures (e.g., creamy vs. crunchy)
Balance taste by adding its opposite or its complement.

I use basil a lot. I will add it at the very end of cooking a dish, and it will totally change where the dish is going. Added at the last second, it gives a minty freshness that was not there before. Basil says “fresh” and “alive” to me. And although you can get it year-round, I associate it with summer.
I think particularly of fish and shellfish with basil. I cook a lobster with a sauce of sweet Muscat or Sauternes, curry, and lime. This is a dish that has been played with. The shells have been chopped up, added to mirepoix, and turned into sauce. Then there’s wine. So when the basil hits, you have this whole new thing going on. It opens up the dish and makes it light. It goes against the “worked-on” aspect of the dish.

BEEF—STEAK TARTARE










Michael Lomonaco of Porter House New York on Cooking Steak


Aging: Aging is important because it tenderizes the steak. The aging process breaks down the fibers and dehydrates the steak, concentrating its flavor. A dryaged steak has a more minerally and sharp edge to it, versus fresh meat that tastes sweeter. It is critical to the flavor and adds to the cost because it takes four weeks of aging to achieve it.
Seasoning: All our steaks are seasoned with coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper just prior to cooking, which draws out the flavor while they cook. A squeeze of lemon makes a good Tuscan steak taste even better. If you are in Italy and eating “bistecca Fiorentina,” what you are having is an Italian porterhouse. The steak is grilled over dried grape vines and served with a drizzle of green olive oil from the first pressing of the new harvest and lemons on the side.
Cooking: A steak should be cooked rare to medium rare. “Rare” is a little cool inside and hot on the exterior. “Medium rare” is just a shade past, and only warm in the middle. Cooking a steak beyond that point, it starts to toughen up and the fat oozes out, making it increasingly dry and tough.
Saucing: Part of looking forward is looking back. Sauces provide the connection to historical French and Italian cooking. In the gastronomic world, the saucier was the top cook in the kitchen. It is all about building layer upon layer of complexity in a sauce. It is most often sweet and sour, to cut through the richness of the fat of the steak. Red wine sauce has the acidity to cut richness, with sweetness from caramelized shallots, and it enhances the beef flavor. We also make a homemade barbecue sauce as our steak sauce, which is sweet from light brown sugar and molasses, tart from red wine vinegar, and smoky from chipotle peppers.

BRUNCH


Customers are picky at brunch. They have all cooked what they think they like, they think they can do it slightly better than we can, and they want it twice as fast. So, we take the classics like pancakes or French toast, use them as building blocks, and push them a little further.
We will offer seasonal pancakes. In the winter, we’ll make buckwheat pancakes with cinnamon and glazed oranges. Bridging spring into summer, we’ll offer corn and saffron pancakes with a spicy poached pear and fresh ricotta. Saffron and corn work really well together because of the floral nature of the saffron and sweetness of the corn. We will use poached pears on the pancakes until switching to blueberries for the summer, which give a real pop. The pears are poached in a red wine syrup with aleppo chile that is a sundried chile with a rich, round, sweet spice to it. The chile is not noticeable, but it acts like an acid by lightening, plus cutting the sugar and richness of, the pancake.

CHEESE—IN GENERAL

Taste: sweet–sour
Function: cooling


apples
breads, esp. neutral-flavored
celery, esp. with cheese sauces and dishes
cherries, esp. with soft cheeses
cured meats, esp. ham
dates, esp. Medjool
dried fruits, esp. dates, figs grapes
nuts, esp. hazelnuts, walnuts
pears




Since cheese is a near-perfect food, I sometimes look for the few nutrients missing in cheese that can be found in other foods. The two essential nutrients that cheese does not provide are vitamin C and fiber. This recommends fruits especially—and makes a great start to the day: cheese, some high-fiber vitamin C–rich fruit, some whole grain organic bread, and coffee. The breads I prefer with cheese are usually neutral flavored, though I fully appreciate the nutty or herbed or fruity breads as natural partners for cheeses. The main reason I prefer neutral flavors in my breads is because I don’t want to meddle with the flavors in the cheeses themselves. I’m kind of a purist on that! Usually, the softer the cheese, the harder the bread—to an extent. And high-pectin, high-fiber fruits [e.g., apples, pears, apricots, plums, nectarines, peaches, figs] make natural accompaniments for many, many cheeses.

Gina DePalma of New York’s Babbo on Babbo’s Cheese Plate


At Babbo, I oversee the cheese selection, which has seven choices. The biggest challenge with Italian cheese is that there are so many “superstars” that you just can’t not offer them. So, in the seven slots we have many standard choices but they are amazing:


• Parmigiano-Reggiano: This is the “undisputed king of all cheeses” according to Mario [Batali]!
• Taleggio: This washed-rind cheese is very wet, has the distinctive orange color, and is gooey. The interior is sweet and the rind is assertive.
• Gorgonzola Piccante: This is firmer, bluer, nutty, and just amazing!
• Coach Farm Goat: Though it is not from Italy, it is the goat cheese we choose. [Mario Batali’s wife’s family owns the Coach Farm Dairy.]
• Robiola: This is a soft-ripened cheese from Piedmont.
• Pecorino: This is a sheep’s milk cheese that is nothing like the Pecorino-Romano that you get in your deli to grate over pasta. This is made in many areas around Italy. We may use one from the south or Tuscany or one that is rubbed with tomato or aged underground from another part of the country.
• The Seventh Cheese: I play around with the seventh cheese and change it often but a recent favorite is a Piave, which is like an English Cheddar. It is from the Veneto along the Piave River.

Andrew Carmellini of New York’s A Voce on Cooking Chicken as a Two-Part Process—and Applying It to Chicken Cacciatore


1. Brining: Sometimes the older techniques inspire me for deeper flavors. Many of these techniques are overlooked. Take brining, for instance. Brining has been done forever with pork chops and chicken, and for the last five years you have heard about it with turkey. The success of brining is more about the salt and it getting in there and softening the protein strands. It is less about all the other flavoring agents.
If you want to get started in your kitchen, start with a skin- and bone-on chicken breast. Grab some kosher salt, sugar, or honey as I do, some water, and brine the breast for 30 minutes. When you pull it out of the brine, rinse it, dry it, and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours so the moisture comes out. You will notice the difference in the texture. The marinated chicken—even if you overcook it—will not be dry. It is the best.
2. Marinating: The chicken on my menu right now is brined and then marinated for 24 hours. It is crazy how good the chicken becomes. The marinade is made up of roasted garlic, Sicilian oregano, red pepper flakes, lots of lemon, thyme, and olive oil. We joke that it tastes like Zesty Italian Wish-Bone Dressing. It is so delicious.
The finished dish is served with poached and sautéed artichoke, roasted pepper grilled over wood, fennel, and roasted spring onions. These vegetables are all tossed with pesto, and the dish is finished with a tomato sauce made with foamy tomato water and thyme.


Chicken Cacciatore
We opened up A Voce with chicken cacciatore on our menu and when people heard the name of the dish, they’d just yawn. A lot of times, this dish is just chicken scaloppine with peppers and tomatoes. Ours is a whole different dish: the chicken is on the bone, and brined first, which makes it nice and moist. With it, we serve a homemade peperonata with roasted peppers, onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, rosemary, fresh bay leaf, fresh thyme, and piment d’Espelette [a pepper from France with a smoky flavor]. Here is a place where technique plays a role in the flavor: When you roast peppers, the best way to get the skin off is to put them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let them steam. When they are done, you are left with the pepper liquid. What we do is cook with that liquid.
To finish this dish, we put a big scoop of the pepper mixture, tomato sauce, garlic puree, onion, red wine vinegar, and fresh bay leaf on the chicken and put it in the oven to roast. The chicken cooks in its own juice then is served with roasted potatoes. It is delicious.
What we are doing is layering the flavors. You have the technique of brining the chicken, elevating the flavor profile of the peppers with the sweetness of the onions and herbs, adding a little heat from the piment d’Espelette, and giving body to the sauce from the pepper juice, which is distilled pepper brandy.

When it comes to chocolate, keep it simple. That’s always good advice! For simplicity at its best, only two ingredients are necessary: heavy cream and chopped chocolate. Bring the cream to a boil, pour it over the chocolate, and it turns into ganache. Serve it warm with just a spoon. How can you do any better? In my new book, I feature a recipe called Cup O’ Dark Chocolate, and essentially it is ganache poured into a cup. Then you grab a cookie, and have at it!

People always ask why I use bittersweet versus semisweet chocolate. Semisweet is chocolate that needs salt. When you add salt to it, it brings up the bitter flavor and makes it taste bittersweet. Semisweet chocolate to me tastes kind of flat. Milk chocolate can taste flat as well. Now that there is Scharffen Berger and El Rey on the market, I find both those chocolates to be really, really great, with both flavor and kick to them. But if you want a killer chocolate dessert, don’t use milk chocolate.
When I write a dessert menu, there will be a couple of chocolate desserts, with one being a killer chocolate and the other a lighter option, like chocolate with bananas. If you don’t have something intensely chocolate, chocolate lovers are very, very unhappy. Banana soufflé with chocolate is not considered a chocolate dessert. You have to be careful with a killer chocolate dessert—you can’t just put chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate together. There has to be balance so the dessert is not too rich. To achieve balance, turn to coffee or caramel because they pair so well and help to intensify the chocolate flavor.
For some desserts, I like to combine white and dark chocolate, or milk and dark chocolate, to give balance and cut intensity. It sounds crazy, but you can use one chocolate to mellow the flavor of another.

My dessert of milk chocolate pot de crème, caramel foam, maple syrup, and Maldon sea salt served in an emptied-out eggshell symbolizes that a few ingredients can come together in a way that is greater than the sum of their parts. The key ingredient which ties it together is the Maldon sea salt. This combination elevates all the ingredients.

My coconut rice pudding strudel was the result of Takashi’s influence. [Takashi Yagihashi was his chef at Detroit’s Tribute restaurant.] Dessert has to make sense in the context of the rest of the meal. Being a pastry chef is exciting because you have a lot of autonomy, but you are still working within the chef’s framework. Takashi’s food was very Asian-influenced. This dish was meant to bring in Asian ingredients in a new way yet be something familiar.
So we have rice pudding flavored with coconut, lemongrass, ginger, and vanilla, and diced apricot for texture. At the time I was introduced to frie de brique, which is a Moroccan dough that is like a cross between phyllo and a wonton wrapper. I would wrap these ingredients in this dough and then sauté them in clarified butter and slice them like a spring roll. Alongside I served green tea ice cream. This covered a lot of bases for me: the warm and cold temperatures, the Asian influence, and doing something with boring old rice pudding.

We participate in an event called “Plate and Pitchfork” that is held on a farm with the food from the farm. The guests sit in the field among the corn and tomatoes, and we cook a meal for them on a couple of grills.
I made a corn soup for this event. We removed the husks, then cut the kernels off the cob. Then we used the husks, which produce a juice, to make a stock for the soup. If you were to use cobs, you wouldn’t get the same flavor. It is important to keep the corn flavor pure. Most cooks would throw in a bunch of vegetables in the stock, and what you’d get then is a vegetable stock with corn. I want to have a corny flavor in the end. We made a stock using the corn husks cooked with a little onion, water, and salt, and let it cook for about 45 minutes. What came out was the most amazing sweet broth. We added the corn, pureed it, and served it chilled. It was so sweet and full of corn flavor you would have sworn there were cream and sugar in it.

Emily Luchetti of Farallon in San Francisco on When and How to Serve Dessert


The older I get, the more I like my dessert at 3:00 in the afternoon. I like it all by itself, it has no competition and you are usually hungry. Your taste buds are wide awake and you can appreciate what it is. Of course if we have people over for dinner I can’t get away with not serving dessert!
When you serve a dessert after a meal you are already full, not in a bad way, but if you had a first course and main course your palate has gone through many flavor components. At home I always take a little break and give people a breather between dinner and dessert. I’ll have my guests help with the dishes or, if it’s a formal party, I’ll let them talk for a half hour and finish off the red wine. It is not just for their stomachs but for the palate as well.
I hate when it comes to slicing a dessert and someone says, “No, no, that is too big!” I used to fight it and take it personally, so now I just ask in advance. The guest appreciates it, has a small piece, and then has seconds. It is recognizing that everyone has their own choice regarding how much they want to eat. If I am serving a shortcake, I will put the fruit with a little cream on the cake, then pass a bowl of whipped cream, so whether they want to pile it or keep it light, they can.





DESSERTS


Tips: Sweetness satiates the appetite, so generally end a meal on a sweet note.
Even sweet desserts should be in balance (their acidity, saltiness, etc.).
Dessert wine should always be sweeter than the dessert it accompanies.

I have always loved to mix meat and fish in a very delicate way. I went to Cut [Wolfgang Puck’s steak restaurant] and had my first true Kobe beef steak. I begged Lee [Hefter, the chef] for his source! Surf and turf is not as much about having a piece of meat and fish on the plate as about the ideas they create for flavor combinations. The Kobe beef triggered everything. I can’t serve steak at a fish restaurant, but the Kobe was so good I had to find a way to justify it on the menu. I came up with Kobe beef and escalar, with a brown butter that is classic with the fish. The final dish was inspired by having Korean barbecue at a friend’s house, which is when I realized how to bring it together.

Halibut from the East Coast is the most delicate and silky fish. It is different than Alaskan halibut, which is drier, meatier, and more robust. East Coast halibut is so delicate that anything can kill it. That is why we steam and poach so much here: Even searing it too strongly in the pan will hurt a piece of halibut.

HERBS


(See specific herbs)





Herbs 101
with Jerry Traunfeld of The Herbfarm, Woodinville, Washington


Working with herbs is very different from working with spices. With herbs, you can really only work with a few at a time. With spices, you can throw so many more together. An Indian dish may have more than a dozen spices in it. Here are some guidelines:


• Know your herb. Herbs range in intensity, so you need to know the profile of the herb you are choosing at the start. You need to be careful; for example, if you add rosemary to chervil it will overpower the chervil.
• You want to pair delicate with delicate or strong with strong. Chervil is possibly the most delicate herb. Lemon basil and lemon thyme would be in the middle. Lemon verbena or tarragon I would consider loud. Then you have bay leaf which is light, until you add twenty together and it becomes strong.
• Not all herbs are created equal, and they can vary within their categories or season. Oregano can be mild, or hot and spicy. With mint, applemint is mild while peppermint is strong. The season also has an effect on rosemary: in the winter, rosemary is mild and in the summer, it is strong.
• Herbs have regional affinities. Mediterranean herbs marry well together. Rosemary and marjoram or thyme and savory are naturals together. Among Asian herbs, lemongrass goes with mint and cilantro or mint and chives. In France, you have lots of combinations: chervil, tarragon, chives, and parsley. The one exception to France’s herbs is tarragon, which is probably best on its own.
• Herbs also have seasonal affinities. Summer vegetables work with summer herbs, as do winter vegetables with winter herbs. In summer, it is basil or marjoram with tomatoes. Basil with zucchini is one of my favorite combinations. In winter, sage and rosemary work with potatoes and root vegetables. Also in winter, one of my favorite combinations is butternut squash with bay leaf and nutmeg. Pumpkin and bay leaf together make the pumpkin taste even more pumpkin-like.
• How to use the chosen herb. Soft-leaved herbs—such as basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, dill, lovage, and sorrel—shouldn’t be cooked because they will lose their flavor. Toughleaved herbs—such as bay leaf, savory, and rosemary—can go into dishes and stand up to heat and cooking.
• Choose an herb that is the same intensity as your protein. Halibut is a gentle-tasting fish, which leads to gentle herbs like cilantro, chives, or chervil. Smelt is a local fish that is oily, so here we look to stronger herbs like oregano, savory, or rosemary.
• Herbs aren’t exclusive to savory dishes. Anise hyssop works with most stone fruits like peaches. Cinnamon basil works with blue huckleberries. Cinnamon with blueberries really intensifies the flavor of the blueberry. Lavender works with plums or peaches. Lemony herbs like basil or anise hyssop work with watermelon. Rosemary works with apples or pears. Sage works with tart cherries. Tarragon works with muskmelon.




We grow forty different tomatoes and eight different basils. Our farmer planted the tomatoes surrounded by the basil, and I thought he did it because they taste good together. It turns out that doing so attracts beneficial insects to each. Our farmer believes that tomato and basil work so well on the plate because they work so well in the field. He also explained that if you plant certain basils next to tomatoes, you can taste it in the tomato.



I am a big fan of roasting and resting meat on herbs. If you roast a rib eye, prime rib, or filet mignon, most people would put it on a sheet tray with a roasting rack. One day, I didn’t have a roasting rack but I had a lot of thyme and savory and rosemary, so I threw the meat on top and roasted it. The technique did the trick by keeping the meat from the juices and it also enhanced the flavor that much more. Since then, we have stopped using roasting racks for our meats and switched to herbs. During the roasting process, I like to turn the meat so that the flavor of the herbs penetrates even more. Since you are roasting in a closed oven, the air circulates the herb flavor.

Heating grated horseradish changes the horseradish completely. It makes it more mellow and takes away the bite while keeping its yummy flavor. Horseradish prepared this way works well with Nantucket Bay scallops that are naturally sweet and work with the sweetness of the horseradish. We will also use it in a lemony vinaigrette and dress a smoked trout with it.

Holly Smith of Café Juanita in Seattle on Five Flavors that Will Take You to Northern Italy


White Truffles. The perfect vehicle for white truffles is hand-cut pasta that is egg rich. Eggs that taste like real eggs make a great pasta. Our pasta is egg rich and has 35 egg yolks to a kilo (2.2 pounds) of flour. You can get them in there, it is crazy! The pasta looks like a sunset. On the pasta, I would first put butter barely scented with sage, before shaving the truffles on top.
Nebbiolo. Beef cheeks braised in Nebbiolo [wine]. To keep it simple, we serve roasted turnips and the reduced sauce with pomegranate seeds and that’s it. We braise our cheeks for seven and a half hours. Most braised dishes go four hours, but not beef cheeks—anything less, and they are [still tough].
Anchovies. I love a really acidic anchovy vinaigrette for a bread salad. Anchovies with roasted garlic are like butter at this restaurant; they go in lots of dishes. We put them in lamb, we put them in between potatoes with chicken stock for a gratin. We love them. I like anchovies with sage on each side deep fried for an appetizer. We cook anchovies in olive oil with a little butter until they get toasty, throw in onions to caramelize, and serve this with fish.
Hazelnuts. Chocolate and hazelnut is the perfect combination so we make gianduja and put it inside crepes and warm them and put chestnut honey on top. Most of the time hazelnuts end up in salad or ground for a final dusting for a pasta. Beet pasta that looks like candy wrappers is served on top of a warm plate that has just been smeared with Gorgonzola Piccante, then topped with ground hazelnuts just before it is served. Blue cheese and hazelnuts is it for me.
Goat Meat. I just had spit-roasted goat at Da Cesare. If I knew I was going to die, I would get myself there [to the Piedmont region of Italy]. Roasted goat basted with garlic, olive oil, marjoram, mint, or rosemary is it.

I work with a local lamb farmer in the Willamette Valley who has true spring lamb in the spring. We have a spit and every Friday night we roast a whole lamb. I am a big fan of lamb shoulder. It can take a beating and in the end come out glorious tasting! There is an old French technique where they cook ham in hay. The hay is submerged in water; then they put the ham on it to cook. It is amazing. We adapted this technique to the lamb. We had our farmer collect the hay and grass in the field where the lamb grazed with the thinking that this is what the lamb actually ate. We then dry the hay by letting it sit out overnight on a tray, so it becomes really butterscotchy and barnyardy. You can use any hay for this technique but I’m just a purist.
We brine a boneless shoulder of lamb for 24 hours in a brining solution of 1 cup of salt and ¼ cup of sugar in a gallon of water, [adding] some peppercorns, bay leaf, a couple of cardamom pods, a cinnamon stick, and cumin. The brine is brought to a boil, cooled down, and the lamb goes in. After the brining we rub the lamb with garlic and summer savory and tie it up into a log and put it on the bed of hay, drizzle it with white wine, cover it, and put it in the oven. It is nature going back on itself. The lamb ate the hay, the hay makes the lamb taste better. When it’s cooked, the flavors are intense but pleasant and it becomes something else. When lavender is in season, I’ll throw some in the hay as well and it is delicious.

Vitaly Paley of Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon, on Cooking with Mushrooms


Mushrooms Year-Round
Spring. This is the start of the morel season. One of the reasons I came to work in Oregon was one day I was working in a kitchen in France and a box of morels arrived with a tag on it that said “Oregon.”
Summer. The morels dwindle away, and we get a brief stint of porcini/cepes. Late summer is golden and white chanterelle season.
Fall. The porcini come back and we also get in matsutake mushrooms as well. We have [Pacific Northwest] black and white truffles here and the season starts in November. They are pretty flavorful but it is important to realize they are different from European truffles—not to mention a lot less expensive.
I’m not a big fan of cultivated mushrooms but I do like a few. King oyster or trumpet royal are the same mushroom and it is one of my favorites. Portobellos are also good, though they are a little ‘70s.
I am suspicious of some dried mushrooms you find in the supermarket only because you don’t know how old they are and how much flavor they will have.


Buying and Cleaning Mushrooms
When it comes to mushrooms, every kind needs to be well cleaned because there is nothing worse than getting a mouthful of grit. I wash them all by soaking them in a bowl of water and pulling them out. The key to remember is that you want to use mushrooms soon after washing them. Don’t wash them a day ahead.
For morel mushrooms, you need to know how to cook them, and slicing them up fresh and throwing them in a pan is not it. It is very important to clean them and I recommend blanching them. Fill a pot with cold water, toss in a handful of salt and then the mushrooms. Bring the pot to a boil, scoop out the mushrooms, spread them out, and lightly squeeze them dry. As you dry them, take a good look at them to make sure they are free of twigs and such.


Seasoning Mushrooms
When it comes to seasoning mushrooms, savory works across the board. The seasoning combination that I’ve used in my kitchen from day one is a raw parsley and garlic combination that in French is called persillade. After the mushrooms have been sautéed in butter or olive oil, at the last second you toss in this combination with a pinch of salt. That is all a mushroom needs most of the time!
If you are roasting porcini or king oyster mushrooms, roast them on a bed of savory or thyme for extra flavor.

Good cooking transcends all cultures. You can take inspiration from all around the world and apply it to what you are cooking without making it “fusion.” In some cases, you can even take a classic and make it taste better. I worked with Floyd Cardoz [chef of the Indian restaurant Tabla in New York City] and learned a lot about Indian spicing and technique from him. One technique was turka, which is where you fry spices in oil or ghee [Indian clarified butter] until they pop. It really opens up the flavor of the spices.

NUTS—IN GENERAL


(See also Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)
Weight: heavy
Volume: moderate (varies by nut)
Tips: Always toast nuts before using to enhance flavor and texture.





Marcel Desaulniers of The Trellis in Williamsburg, Virginia, on Nuts


We use a great deal of nuts at the restaurant. On our fall menu, we have nuts in six out of ten entrées. Using nuts has always been one of my hallmarks in terms of adding texture to everything from a salad or soup to entrées and desserts. This philosophy hasn’t changed much since 1987 when I opened. I can’t think of a nut that doesn’t, in essence, work in both sweet and savory dishes.


Dishes from The Trellis in Williamsburg Featuring Nuts


Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Grilled Jumbo Asparagus and Toasted Macadamia Nuts


Grilled Chicken Breast with StoneGround Grits Cake, Toasted Peanuts, and Spicy Peanut Sauce


Chicken Salad: Diced Fresh Chicken Breast, Granny Smith Apples, Pecans, Celery, Raisins, and Mayonnaise on Toasted Buttermilk Bread, Served with Mesclun Greens


Pan-Seared Sea Scallops and Sautéed Shrimp with Country Ham, Shiitakes, Roasted Shallots, and Pecan-Studded Basmati Rice


Spinach Fettuccine with Smoked Tomatoes, Artichokes, Melted Sweet Onions, Fresh Herbs, Toasted Pine Nuts, and Black Pepper Butter


Chunk Light Tuna with Seedless Grapes, Chopped Walnuts, and Mayonnaise on Toasted Whole Wheat Bread Garnished with Watercress, Grapes, and Walnuts







The quality of chopped nuts can never compare with the quality of whole nuts. In 26 years, we have never bought chopped pecans because the quality is so different, despite the fact that it would be a lot less expensive.
I recommend simply chopping by hand or, in the case of something like a pecan, breaking it with your fingers. Pecans have so much moisture that if you chop them, you lose what is special about their texture. People tend to put nuts into the food processor and the next thing you know, you have powder and not pieces.



Always toast nuts to bring up the flavor. If you don’t toast the nuts before adding them to a dish, they tend to come out soggy when the dish is done. The one exception would be if they are going on top of a tart going into the oven, because then they would be overtoasted.

On Selecting the Right Oil


Your choice of olive oil always depends on what you are using it for. In general, you don’t want an oil that is super-assertive, green, or peppery. You want a good olive flavor. I use a 100 percent Italian blend. It is silly to cook with 100 percent extra-virgin olive oil if you are just sautéing something. If the oil is going to stay in what you are making, like a sauce, then start with extra-virgin olive oil. When I make a tomato sauce, that is what I am starting with.




Olive oil comes in a wide variety of flavors and strengths even from the same region, much like wine:


• I use a heavier (e.g., Puglian, Umbrian, Sicilian) olive oil on biggerflavored dishes. A strong olive oil goes well on bean puree or a strong vegetable like dandelion greens. In the United States, you would put a barbecue sauce on a grilled meat; in Italy, you would use a strong olive oil.

Pairing Pastas with Sauces


Which sauces pair best with which pastas? We asked chef Odette Fada of New York City’s San Domenico restaurant.


• Angel hair: In Italy, angel hair pasta is served to old people who can’t chew. It’s for grandparents, or for others to eat when they are sick. The problem with angel hair pasta is it’s so thin it’s hard to cook al dente, and I like my pasta a little chewy.
• Bow tie: Fresh bow tie is great when made by hand, because it stays folded and doesn’t open into a square. I like to serve it with vegetables and tomato-based sauces.
• Fettuccine: This is a flavorful pasta and is good with a Bolognese sauce.
• Fusilli: I like their [corkscrew] shape, but they tend to break easily so they are not that attractive when you cook them in a restaurant setting. I like them at home in a salad or with some pesto because the pesto sticks to it.
• Hollow pasta [e.g., macaroni, penne, rigatoni]: Good with sauces that have big chunks in them so that the sauce pieces go inside whole. I like to do penne with fresh peas because the peas will slip inside, so you’ll sometimes get a little surprise when you’re chewing.
• Pappardelle: This is a strong, rustic pasta. I like it with rabbit sauce, a ragoût, or a fish sauce that has some character.
• Small pasta [e.g., rice-, shell-, or star-shaped]: These are good for soups and brothy dishes. For example, you would use them with a brothy fish dish.
• Spaghetti: Everything goes with spaghetti! It is a pasta that sauce sticks to. Everything from tomato sauce to pesto to pecorino with black pepper is great with spaghetti.


Or, if you’re starting with the sauce:


• Carbonara: Spaghetti or bucatini, you want a pasta that the sauce will stick to.
• Cream: Fettuccine, pappardelle, or gnocchi, since cream is so rich you want a strongflavored pasta or, in the last case, gnocchi—one that is made with some egg in it.
• Game: Pappardelle or fettuccine; you want an egg-rich pasta with some flavor.
• Olive oil and garlic: Spaghetti.
• Pesto: Fusilli.
• Tomato: This works with almost all pasta shapes, from small to large.


I have played with lots of flavored pasta doughs. One of my favorites is olive because it holds its flavor. Other flavors that hold up well are squid ink and saffron. I have also made a pappardelle with cocoa powder that I paired with game sauce that worked great. If you wanted to achieve a particular color, you could create red pasta with beets, green pasta with spinach, and black pasta with squid ink.

Chef Odette Fada of New York’s San Domenico on Making Ravioli


I love ravioli! Anything and everything goes in my ravioli—I have used everything from chestnuts to cheese to fish, meat, and vegetables. You can vary the ravioli dough as well as the stuffing. For example, I serve ravioli stuffed with sea urchin and the dough is light and made with just flour and water. For a stronger filling like lamb, I will use some egg in the dough which makes it bigger flavored. One of my favorite ravioli stuffings is black truffle and pancetta. The truffle provides a crunchiness when you bite into it.
One of the greatest ravioli we do dates back to the chef for the last king of Italy at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is stuffed with spinach, truffle, Parmesan cheese, and an egg yolk, and served with butter, truffle, and Parmesan cheese. When the ravioli is cooked, it is served with the yolk warm but not cooked. It is truly an amazing dish.
In Italy during the winter, you would typically have some slices of sausage on top of a plate of lentils. I decided to combine the two into a ravioli dish. Now, one of my other favorite dishes is our ravioli stuffed with cotechino [sausage] and lentils. The lentils are cooked with rosemary, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, and prosciutto skin, and go into the ravioli with the sausage, parsley, and Parmesan cheese. The dish is finished with some strong extra-virgin olive oil, parsley, and a crack of pepper.

This salad has roasted pear, Roquefort cheese, lemon, and olive oil and is garnished with borage flowers. The sauce is burnt caramel with pepper deglazed with Coteaux du Layon, which is sweet but higher in acid than Sauternes. The caramel sauce keeps you awake!
Cheese and fruit: Blue cheese is sharp and hits your palate, then the pear calms it down.
Salad greens: We use herbs in our salad and this one has fennel, thyme, tarragon, parsley, and anise hyssop.

Odette Fada of New York’s San Domenico on Risotto


I am from Northern Italy and grew up eating risotto. Back then, we mainly ate risotto Milanese [i.e., saffron risotto, traditionally served with osso buco or with a mild pork sausage crumbled in with some rosemary]. We would also put it in soup—or even just eat it simply with some grated cheese.
I love it because it only takes one pan, and it is ready in 20 minutes! People think it takes a long time but if you were to cook a piece of fish, wash greens, and make a salad dressing, that would take just as long.
You can make risotto with almost anything. I love it with fruit, vegetables, or fish. One of my favorite fruit risottos is a seasonal one with pears and Gorgonzola. The pears give a nice, sweet crunch to the dish. I also like making risotto with Prosecco, strawberries, and nettles.
A classic combination in Italy in fall is game with blueberry jam and mushrooms. I have adapted this and for over twenty years have been serving risotto with porcini mushrooms and blueberries tossed in at the last second.
I also like to make a risotto with fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, or oregano—and then at the end I’ll cover it with an extra-thin slice of lard [pork jowl] that has a mild flavor. It just melts into the risotto and is out of this world.
Each ingredient you add to your risotto will dictate when it should be added. If it is something delicate like a berry, it gets added very late so it will not break up. If you are making a seafood risotto—say, with octopus—it should be added early so it has time to cook all the way through.

I wanted to come up with a panna cotta that was unlike anyone else’s. I was walking down the street thinking of Italian dishes and risotto Milanese [which is made with saffron] came to mind. This led me to think about saffron, and the idea of adding saffron to my panna cotta. After Ruth Reichl mentioned it in the New York Times review of Babbo, Mario [Batali] told me I could never take it off the menu!

King White Salmon by Gabriel Kreuther of New York City’s The Modern




The salmon is roasted, and served with warm, slightly charred cucumbers, which I like because they are rarely used cooked. We use market vegetables that right now are bok choy and peas. I have added some trout caviar for a briny flavor because salmon is on the sweet side. The dish is then finished with a hickory broth.
For the hickory broth, we smoke some hickory chips, wrap them in cheesecloth with juniper berries and peppercorns, and then submerge them in water to make a broth. This creates a smoked sauce that is light and tasty. What we have here is a “wood stock” that makes perfect sense with the salmon because so often salmon is smoked. After the wood comes out, you taste the broth to adjust it. It may need some more water to cut the wood and smoke flavor, or it might need to be reduced to intensify it. We finish the sauce with a little half-and-half, and foam it with a handheld mixer.

Vitaly Paley of Portland’s Paley’s Place on Cooking Salmon on a Plank


Salmon is a big part of cooking in the Northwest. We get ours anywhere from Oregon up to Alaska.
The first cooking process that comes to mind in this part of the country is called cedar planking, which is a Native American technique. You see planking in all the best cooking catalogs, but the problem is that you cook the fish, throw it out, and keep the plank because the plank is inevitably more expensive than the fish! So here is one tip: Instead, do what we do and go to a lumber yard and pick up untreated cedar shingles. They come in a huge bundle for $16.
To get the most out of plank cooking, the salmon needs to be brined or marinated. I have two favorite marinades—one that is wet, and one that is dry. The wet marinade is a 60/40 mixture of soy sauce and cream sherry, lots of sliced ginger, heads of garlic cut in half, and chopped scallions. The sherry adds just a touch of sweetness to the fish, which I like. Let the fish sit in that marinade for a couple of hours and then it is ready to take on the smoke.
The dry marinade is a more traditional marinade of a 60/40 ratio of brown sugar and salt with orange zest [grated] on a microplane [fine grater]. I mix this all together and lavishly rub it over a salmon with the skin on, which protects it from getting too salty or sweet. The sugar in this rub balances out the salt and adds another dimension to the fish with caramelization happening a lot quicker. The sweetness is almost hidden; it is that “What’s-that-flavor?” aspect to the fish. Marinate for a couple of hours, then wipe off the rub slightly, and it is ready to go. The 60/40 ratio of sugar to salt is good because it is pretty forgiving if you leave the fish in the marinade a half hour too long.
I recommend brushing the plank lightly with some olive oil, throwing it on a hot grill, putting the fish on, and letting it catch on fire, because when the plank is on fire, that is the flavor you are looking for. When the burning plank gets close to the fish, cover the grill to smother the fire and let the smoke do the rest of the work.

Nantucket bay scallops are magically delicious, and pairing them with duck fat is an unusual combination that works. It is essentially scallops Provençal, but instead of using olive oil you use duck fat that gives you a silky quality. It is an enormously fun dish to cook and you use your eyes and nose to cook it. You heat up duck fat, getting it really hot, then sauté the scallops really fast. After taking them out, add chopped garlic and tomato concasse. It moves along quickly; hit it with chicken stock, adjust it with some lemon juice, and let it reduce and emulsify. You add your scallops back in with some chiffonade of basil and it’s done.

Dishes























We still have the same philosophy as when we opened: The fish is still the star of the plate. We have not budged from there, but every dish has a sauce that completes the dish, and brings together all the elements on the plate and creates harmony. We pay homage to seafood and are dedicated to it, but use a wide palette from rich sauces to broths and a variety of spices and emulsions.
What makes a dish work is the way we make and treat our sauce. We don’t make a sauce in the morning and use it for the day. Can you imagine if you made coffee in the morning and came back at noon to taste it? It would be disgusting. The same for tea: if you left a tea bag in your tea all day, at night it would be awful.

When you add acid to a sauce, it lifts everything up. Lemon is my favorite; I use lemon and orange the way a chef uses salt and pepper. Whether I add the juice, zest, or confit depends on the cooking application:


• Juice: If a recipe calls for water, why use that? Why not add flavor and use orange juice?
• Zest: If I make panna cotta, it will have orange zest in it but it will not taste orangey. If I make a cake, I also use zest.

Spain in the New World: How American Chefs Are Influenced by Spain












We use olive oil as a condiment. In Spain it is not uncommon to see something swimming in olive oil. Anchovies will be covered in oil, and after you eat the anchovies you just dip your bread in the oil. Even a dish that is cooked in olive oil will get a drizzle of raw oil on top for finishing. In Spanish cooking it is hard for me to name a dish that doesn’t get olive oil. We will cook mushrooms in olive oil and serve them with oil on top.

I remember asking myself, How can I make a salad into a dessert? The result of my experimentation bore no resemblance to a salad: I used olive oil to make an almond financier; because a financier is not a financier without the brown butter, I substituted olive oil for half the brown butter. I served this with a balsamic vinegar ice cream, and a basil-infused strawberry consommé.

TRUFFLES, PACIFIC NORTHWEST


Season: autumn
Weight: light

beef, esp. with black truffles
butter
celery root
crab, esp. with white truffles
eggs
game birds, esp. with black truffles
leeks, melted, esp. with black truffles
meats, red, esp. with black truffles
pasta, esp. with white truffles
potatoes, esp. with white truffles
salads, esp. with white truffles
seafood, esp. with white truffles
shellfish, esp. with white truffles
vegetables, root, esp. with white truffles





Jerry Traunfeld of Woodinville, Washington’s The Herbfarm on Pacific Northwest Truffles


Northwest truffles are very good for what they are. What they are not is French or Italian truffles, which are stronger. Northwest truffles pair really well with celery root puree. We serve a ravioli filled with celery root and an egg yolk. The egg yolk is raw when the ravioli is cooked; when it is served, the dish is topped with butter and shaved truffle.
The white truffles are milder than the black. I especially like the white truffles with seafood such as shellfish, especially crab. They also work with root vegetables and potatoes.
The black truffles are a little funkier, and work with red meats and game birds.
We like to prepare melted leeks, which are leeks cooked in water until they are incredibly soft, which then get a shaving of black truffle and are served with wagu beef.
